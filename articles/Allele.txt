An '''allele''' (/əˈliːl/) <ref>https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/allele</ref><ref>https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/allele</ref> is the variant form of a given [[gene]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0307-4412(95)90659-2|title=The encyclopedia of molecular biology|journal=Biochemical Education|volume=23|issue=2|pages=1165|year=1995|last1=Wood|first1=E.J.}}</ref> Sometimes, different alleles can result in different observable [[phenotypic trait]]s, such as different [[pigmentation]]. However, most genetic variations result in little or no observable variation.

The word "allele" is a short form of '''allelomorph''' ("other form", a word coined by [[William Bateson]]<ref>{{cite web | last = Craft | first = Jude | title = Genes and genetics: the language of scientific discovery | work = Genes and genetics | publisher = [[Oxford English Dictionary]] | date = 2013 | url = http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/shapers-of-english/genes-and-genetics-the-language-of-scientific-discovery/  | accessdate = 2016-01-14 }}</ref>), which was used in the early days of [[genetics]] to describe variant forms of a [[gene]] detected as different [[phenotypes]]. It derives from the Greek prefix ''ἀλλήλ'', ''allel'', meaning "reciprocal" or "each other", which itself is related to the Greek adjective ἄλλος (allos; cognate with Latin "alius"), meaning "other".

Most [[multicellular organism]]s have two sets of [[chromosome]]s; that is, they are [[diploid]].  These chromosomes are referred to as [[homologous chromosome]]s. If both alleles at a gene (or [[Locus (genetics)|locus]]) on the homologous chromosomes are the same, they and the organism are [[homozygous]] with respect to that gene (or locus). If the alleles are different, they and the organism are [[heterozygous]] with respect to that gene.

==Dominant and recessive alleles==
{{main article|Dominance (genetics)}}
In many cases, genotypic interactions between the two alleles at a locus can be described as [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] or [[recessive]], according to which of the two homozygous phenotypes the [[heterozygote]] most resembles. Where the heterozygote is indistinguishable from one of the homozygotes, the allele involved is said to be [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] to the other, which is said to be [[recessive]] to the former.<ref name="Essential genetics: A genomics perspective"/> The degree and pattern of dominance varies among loci. This type of interaction was first formally described by [[Gregor Mendel]]. However, many traits defy this simple categorization and the phenotypes are modeled by [[co-dominance]] and [[Quantitative trait locus|polygenic inheritance]].

The term "[[wild type]]" allele is sometimes used to describe an allele that is thought to contribute to the typical phenotypic character as seen in "wild" populations of organisms, such as fruit flies (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''). Such a "wild type" allele was historically regarded as dominant (overpowering - always expressed), common, and normal, in contrast to "[[mutant]]" alleles regarded as recessive, rare, and frequently deleterious. It was formerly thought that most individuals were homozygous for the "wild type" allele at most gene loci, and that any alternative "mutant" allele was found in homozygous form in a small minority of "affected" individuals, often as [[genetic diseases]], and more frequently in heterozygous form in "[[Genetic carrier|carriers]]" for the mutant allele. It is now appreciated that most or all gene loci are highly polymorphic, with multiple alleles, whose frequencies vary from population to population, and that a great deal of genetic variation is hidden in the form of alleles that do not produce obvious phenotypic differences.

==Multiple alleles==
{{multiple image

The interaction of multiple genes—and the variation in these genes ("alleles") between individuals—help to determine a person's eye color [[phenotype]]. Eye color is influenced by [[pigment]]ation of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and the frequency-dependence of the light [[scattering]] by the [[Turbidity|turbid]] medium within the [[Stroma of iris|stroma]] of the iris.

[[File:ABO blood type.svg|thumb|right|300px|In the [[ABO blood group system]], a person with Type A blood displays A-antigens and may have a genotype I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>A</sup> or I<sup>A</sup>i. A person with Type B blood displays B-antigens and may have the genotype I<sup>B</sup>I<sup>B</sup> or I<sup>B</sup>i. A person with Type AB blood displays both A- and B-antigens and has the genotype I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup> and a person with Type O blood, displaying neither antigen, has the genotype ii.]]

A population or [[species]] of organisms typically includes multiple alleles at each locus among various individuals. Allelic variation at a locus is measurable as the number of alleles ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]) present, or the proportion of heterozygotes in the population. A [[null allele]] is a gene variant that lacks the gene's normal function because it either is not expressed, or the expressed protein is inactive.

For example, at the gene locus for the [[ABO]] [[blood type]] [[carbohydrate]] [[antigen]]s in humans,<ref name="OnlineMendelianInheritanceinMan"/> classical genetics recognizes three alleles, I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>B</sup>, and i, that determine compatibility of [[blood transfusion]]s. Any individual has one of six possible [[genotype]]s (I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>A</sup>i, I<sup>B</sup>I<sup>B</sup>, I<sup>B</sup>i, I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup>, and ii) that produce one of four possible [[phenotype]]s: "Type A" (produced by I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>A</sup> homozygous and I<sup>A</sup>i heterozygous genotypes), "Type B" (produced by I<sup>B</sup>I<sup>B</sup> homozygous and I<sup>B</sup>i heterozygous genotypes), "Type AB" produced by I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup> heterozygous genotype, and "Type O" produced by ii homozygous genotype. (It is now known that each of the A, B, and O alleles is actually a class of multiple alleles with different DNA sequences that produce proteins with identical properties: more than 70 alleles are known at the ABO locus.<ref name="Sequence variation at the human ABO locus"/> Hence an individual with "Type A" blood may be an AO heterozygote, an AA homozygote, or an AA heterozygote with two different "A" alleles.)

==Allele and genotype frequencies==
{{main article|Allele frequency}}
The frequency of alleles in a diploid population can be used to predict the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes (see [[Hardy-Weinberg principle]]). For a simple model, with two alleles:

: <math>p + q=1 \, </math>

: <math>p^2 + 2pq + q^2=1 \,</math>

where ''p'' is the frequency of one allele and ''q'' is the frequency of the alternative allele, which necessarily sum to unity. Then, ''p''<sup>2</sup> is the fraction of the population homozygous for the first allele, 2''pq'' is the fraction of heterozygotes, and ''q''<sup>2</sup> is the fraction homozygous for the alternative allele. If the first allele is dominant to the second then the fraction of the population that will show the dominant phenotype is ''p''<sup>2</sup> + 2''pq'', and the fraction with the recessive phenotype is ''q''<sup>2</sup>.

With three alleles:

: <math>p + q + r = 1 \, </math> and

: <math>p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2pq + 2pr + 2qr = 1. \,</math>

In the case of multiple alleles at a diploid locus, the number of possible genotypes (G) with a number of alleles (a) is given by the expression:

: <math>G= \frac{a(a+1)}{2}. </math>

==Allelic dominance in genetic disorders==
A number of [[genetic disorders]] are caused when an individual inherits two recessive alleles for a single-gene trait. Recessive genetic disorders include [[albinism]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[galactosemia]], [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU), and [[Tay–Sachs disease]]. Other disorders are also due to recessive alleles, but because the gene locus is located on the X chromosome, so that males have only one copy (that is, they are [[hemizygosity|hemizygous]]), they are more frequent in males than in females. Examples include red-green [[color blindness]] and [[fragile X syndrome]].

Other disorders, such as [[Huntington disease]], occur when an individual inherits only one dominant allele.

==Epialleles==
While [[heredity|heritable traits]] are typically studied in terms of genetic alleles, [[epigenetic]] marks such as [[DNA methylation]] can be inherited at specific genomic regions in certain species, a process termed [[transgenerational epigenetic inheritance]]. The term ''epiallele'' is used to distinguish these heritable marks from traditional alleles, which are defined by nucleotide sequence.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Daxinger|first1=Lucia|last2=Whitelaw|first2=Emma|title=Understanding transgenerational epigenetic inheritance via the gametes in mammals|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=31 January 2012|volume=13|issue=3|page=155|doi=10.1038/nrg3188}}</ref> A specific class of epiallele, the [[metastable epiallele]]s, has been discovered in mice and in humans which is characterized by stochastic (probabilistic) establishment of epigenetic state that can be mitotically inherited.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rakyan|first1=Vardhman K|last2=Blewitt|first2=Marnie E|last3=Druker|first3=Riki|last4=Preis|first4=Jost I|last5=Whitelaw|first5=Emma|title=Metastable epialleles in mammals|journal=Trends in Genetics|date=July 2002|volume=18|issue=7|pages=348–351|doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(02)02709-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Waterland|first1=RA|last2=Dolinoy|first2=DC|last3=Lin|first3=JR|last4=Smith|first4=CA|last5=Shi|first5=X|last6=Tahiliani|first6=KG|title=Maternal methyl supplements increase offspring DNA methylation at Axin Fused.|journal=Genesis (New York, N.Y. : 2000)|date=September 2006|volume=44|issue=9|pages=401–6|pmid=16868943|doi=10.1002/dvg.20230}}</ref>
