'''Antoninus Pius''' ({{lang-la|Titus Fulvus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius}};<ref name="Weigel, Antoninus Pius">Weigel, ''Antoninus Pius''</ref><ref>In [[Classical Latin]], Antoninus' name would be inscribed as TITVS AELIVS HADRIANVS ANTONINVS AVGVSTVS PIVS.</ref> 19 September 86 CE – 7 March 161 CE), also known as '''Antoninus''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from 138 to 161. He was one of the Five Good Emperors in the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty]] and the [[Aurelia (gens)|Aurelii]].<ref name="Bowman, p. 150">Bowman, p. 150</ref>

He acquired the [[cognomen|name]] [[Pius]] after his accession to the throne, either because he compelled the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deify]] his adoptive father [[Hadrian]],<ref>Birley, p. 54; Dio, 70:1:2</ref> or because he had saved senators sentenced to death by Hadrian in his later years.<ref>Birley, p. 55, citing the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', ''Life of Hadrian'' 24.4</ref> He died of illness in 161 and was succeeded by his adopted sons [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]] as co-emperors.

==Early life==

===Childhood and family===
He was born as the only child of [[Titus Aurelius Fulvus]], [[consul]] in 89<ref name="Bowman, p. 150">Bowman, p. 150</ref> whose family came from [[Nemausus]] (modern [[Nîmes]]).<ref name="Bury, p. 523">Bury, p. 523</ref> Titus Aurelius Fulvius was the son of a senator of the same name, who, as legate of [[Legio III Gallica]], had supported [[Vespasian]] in his bid to the Imperial office and been rewarded with a suffect consulship, plus an ordinary one under [[Domitian]] in 85. The Aurelii Fulvii were therefore a relatively new senatorial family from [[Gallia Narbonensis]] whose rise to prominence was supported by the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavians]].<ref>Hugo Thomas Dupuis Whitfield, "THE RISE OF NEMAUSUS FROM AUGUSTUS TO ANTONINUS PIUS: A PROSOPOGRAPHICAL STUDY OF NEMAUSIAN SENATORS AND EQUESTRIANS".M.A. Thesis, Queen's University, Ontario, 2012, pages 49/57.

Antoninus was born near [[Lanuvium]]<ref>Harvey, Paul B., ''Religion in republican Italy'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 134; Canduci, p. 39</ref> and his mother was Arria Fadilla. Antoninus’ father died shortly after his 89 ordinary consulship, his son being raised by his maternal grandfather [[Gnaeus Arrius Antoninus]],<ref name="Bowman, p. 150">Bowman, p. 150</ref> reputed by contemporaries to be a man of integrity and culture and a friend of [[Pliny the Younger]]. The Arrii Antoninii were an older senatorial family from Italy, very influential during [[Nerva]]'s reign. Arria Fadilla, Antoninus' mother, married afterwards Publius Julius Lupus, a man of consular rank, suffect consul in 98, and two daughters, Arria Lupula and Julia Fadilla, were born from that union.<ref>Birley, p. 242; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 1:6</ref>

===Marriage and children===
Some time between 110 and 115, Antoninus married Annia Galeria [[Faustina the Elder]].<ref name="Weigel, Antoninus Pius"/> They are believed to have enjoyed a happy marriage. Faustina was the daughter of consul [[Marcus Annius Verus]]<ref name="Bowman, p. 150">Bowman, p. 150</ref> and [[Rupilia]] Faustina (a half-sister to Roman Empress [[Vibia Sabina]]). Faustina was a beautiful woman, and despite (basically unproven) rumours about her character, it is clear that Antoninus cared for her deeply.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Vagi|first1=David L.|title=Coinage and History of the Roman Empire, C. 82 B.C.--A.D. 480: History|date=2000|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9781579583163|page=240|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raE7qzBM-OIC&pg=PA240}}</ref>

Faustina bore Antoninus four children, two sons and two daughters.<ref>Birley, p. 34; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 1:7</ref> They were:
* Marcus Aurelius Fulvus Antoninus (died before 138); his sepulchral inscription has been found at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.<ref name="Magie, David 1921">Magie, David, ''Historia Augusta'' (1921), Life of Antoninus Pius, Note 6</ref><ref>The inscription is {{CIL|06|00988}}.</ref>
* Marcus Galerius Aurelius Antoninus (died before 138); his sepulchral inscription has been found at the Mausoleum of Hadrian in Rome.<ref name="Magie, David 1921"/><ref>The inscription is {{CIL|06|00989}}.</ref> His name appears on a Greek Imperial coin.
* Aurelia Fadilla (died in 135); she married Lucius Lamia Silvanus, consul 145. She appeared to have no children with her husband and her sepulchral inscription has been found in [[Italy]].<ref>Magie, David, ''Historia Augusta'' (1921), Life of Antoninus Pius, Note 7</ref>
* Annia Galeria Faustina Minor or [[Faustina the Younger]] (between 125–130–175), a future Roman Empress, married her maternal cousin, future Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] in 146.<ref name="Bury, p. 523"/>

When Faustina died in 141, Antoninus was greatly distressed.<ref>Bury, p. 528</ref> In honour of her memory, he asked the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to deify her as a goddess, and authorised the construction of a temple to be built in the [[Roman Forum]] in her name, with priestesses serving in her temple.<ref>Birley, p. 77; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 6:7</ref> He had various coins with her portrait struck in her honor. These coins were scripted ‘DIVA FAUSTINA’ and were elaborately decorated. He further created a charity which he founded and called it ''Puellae Faustinianae'' or ''Girls of Faustina'', which assisted destitute girls <ref name="Weigel, Antoninus Pius"/> of good family.<ref>Fernand Daucé : "Découverte à Rennes d'une pièce de Faustine jeune". In: ''Annales de Bretagne''. Tome 75, numéro 1, 1968. pp. 270-276, page 272 Available at [http://www.persee.fr/doc/abpo_0003-391x_1968_num_75_1_2460]. Retrieved October 23, 2015</ref> Finally, Antoninus created a new ''alimenta'' (see [[Grain supply to the city of Rome]]).

After Faustina's death, he lived with a freed woman of hers named Galena Lysistrata instead of entering into a second marriage. Concubinage was a form of getting female companionship preferred by some powerful men in Ancient Rome, especially widowers like Antoninus Pius, Vespasian before him and Marcus Aurelius after him. The woman would not produce any legitimate offspring who would threaten the previously established position as Antoninus' heirs of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. Also, as one could not have a wife and an official concubine (or two concubines) at the same time, Antoninus escaped the pressure of being pressed into a marriage with a woman from a powerful noble family (Later, Marcus Aurelius would also reject the advances of his former fiancee Ceionia Fabia, Lucius Verus's sister, on the grounds of protecting his children from a stepmother, and took a concubine instead). This relationship too appears to be cordial and she is known to have wielded great influence over him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Strong|first1=Anise K.|title=Prostitutes and Matrons in the Roman World|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107148758|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ClSJDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA85}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Lind|first1=Goran|title=Common Law Marriage: A Legal Institution for Cohabitation|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199710539|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-kJxOISFSMC&pg=PA72}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Birley|first1=Anthony R|title=Marcus Aurelius: A Biography|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134695690|page=33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gl5T47CvuDsC&pg=PA33}}</ref>

===Favor with Hadrian===

Having filled the offices of [[quaestor]] and [[praetor]] with more than usual success,<ref>Traver, Andrew G., ''From polis to empire, the ancient world, c. 800 B.C.-A.D. 500'', (2002) p. 33; Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 2:9</ref> he obtained the consulship in 120.<ref name="Weigel, Antoninus Pius"/> He was next appointed by the Emperor [[Hadrian]] as one of the four [[proconsul]]s to administer [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]],<ref name="Bowman, p. 149">Bowman, p. 149</ref> then greatly increased his reputation by his conduct as [[proconsul]] of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], probably during 134–135.<ref name="Bowman, p. 149">Bowman, p. 149</ref>

He acquired much favor with the Emperor Hadrian, who adopted him as his son and successor on 25 February 138,<ref>Bowman, p. 148</ref> after the death of his first adopted son [[Lucius Aelius]],<ref>Bury, p. 517</ref> on the condition that Antoninus would in turn adopt Marcus Annius Verus, the son of his wife's brother, and Lucius, son of Lucius Aelius, who afterwards became the emperors [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]].<ref name="Weigel, Antoninus Pius"/>

By this scheme, Verus, who was already Hadrian's adoptive grandson through his natural father, remained Hadrian's adoptive son through his new father. The adoption of Marcus Aurelius was probably a suggestion of Antoninus himself, since the former was the nephew of the latter's wife and would be his favorite son.

The emperor and his ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' were deified after their death by [[Marcus Aurelius]].]]

On his accession, Antoninus' name became "Imperator Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pontifex Maximus". One of his first acts as Emperor was to persuade the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to grant divine honours to Hadrian, which they had at first refused;<ref name="Bowman, p. 151">Bowman, p. 151</ref> his efforts to persuade the Senate to grant these honours is the most likely reason given for his title of ''Pius'' (dutiful in affection; compare ''[[pietas]]'').<ref>Birley, p. 55; Canduci, p. 39</ref> Two other reasons for this title are that he would support his aged father-in-law with his hand at Senate meetings, and that he had saved those men that Hadrian, during his period of ill-health, had condemned to death.<ref name="Bury, p. 523"/>

Immediately after Hadrian's death, Antoninus approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended: Marcus' betrothal to Ceionia Fabia would be annulled, and he would be betrothed to Faustina, Antoninus' daughter, instead. Faustina's betrothal to Ceionia's brother Lucius Commodus would also have to be annulled. Marcus consented to Antoninus' proposal.<ref>''HA Marcus'' 6.2; ''Verus'' 2.3–4; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 53–54.</ref>

Antoninus built temples, theaters, and mausoleums, promoted the arts and sciences, and bestowed honours and financial rewards upon the teachers of [[rhetoric]] and [[philosophy]].<ref name="Weigel, Antoninus Pius"/> Antoninus made few initial changes when he became emperor, leaving intact as far as possible the arrangements instituted by Hadrian.<ref name="Bowman, p. 151">Bowman, p. 151</ref> Epigraphical and prosopographical research has revealed that Antoninus' imperial ruling team centered around a group of closely knit senatorial families, most of them members of the priestly congregation for the cult of Hadrian, the ''sodales Hadrianales''. According to the German historian [[Hans-Georg Pflaum|H.G. Pflaum]], prosopographical research of Antoninus' ruling team allows us to grasp the deeply conservative character of the ruling senatorial [[caste]]<ref>H.G. Pflaum, "Les prêtres du culte impérial sous le règne d'Antonin le Pieux". In: ''Comptes rendus des séances de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres'', 111ᵉ année, N. 2, 1967. pp. 194-209.

===A non-military reign===

There are no records of any military related acts in his time in which he participated. One modern scholar has written "It is almost certain not only that at no time in his life did he ever see, let alone command, a Roman army, but that, throughout the twenty-three years of his reign, he never went within five hundred miles of a legion".<ref>J. J. Wilkes, ''The Journal of Roman Studies'', Volume LXXV 1985, {{ISSN|0075-4358}}, p. 242.</ref>

His reign was the most peaceful in the entire history of the [[Principate]];<ref name="Bury, p. 525">Bury, p. 525</ref> notwithstanding the fact that there were several military disturbances throughout the Empire in his time. Such disturbances happened in [[Mauretania]] - where a senator was named as governor of [[Mauretania Tingitana]] in place of the usual equestrian procurator<ref>[[René Rebuffat]], '"Enceintes urbaines et insécurité en Maurétanie Tingitane" In: ''[[Mélanges de l'École française de Rome]], Antiquité'', tome 86, n°1. 1974. pp. 501-522. Available at [http://www.persee.fr/doc/mefr_0223-5102_1974_num_86_1_970]. Accessed December 26, 2015</ref> and cavalry reinforcements from Panonnia were brought in,<ref>[[Michel Christol]], "L'armée des provinces pannoniennes et la pacification des révoltes maures sous Antonin le Pieux". In: ''Antiquités africaines'', 17, 1981. pp. 133-141.</ref> towns such as [[Sala Colonia|Sala]] and [[Tipasa]] being fortified.<ref>Michael Grant, ''The Antonines: The Roman Empire in Transition''. Abingdon: Routledge, 1996, ISBN 0-415-13814-0, page 17; Rebuffat "Enceintes urbaines"</ref> Similar disturbances took place in [[Iudaea Province|Iudaea]], and amongst the [[Brigantes]] in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], none of them being considered serious.<ref name="Bury, p. 525">Bury, p. 525</ref> It was however in Britain that Antoninus decided to follow a new, more aggressive path, with the appointment of a new governor in 139, [[Quintus Lollius Urbicus]]<ref name="Bowman, p. 151">Bowman, p. 151</ref> a native of [[Numidia]] and previously governor of [[Germania Inferior]].<ref>Salway, ''A History of Roman Britain''. Oxford University Press: 2001, ISBN 0-19-280138-4, page 149</ref>

Under instructions from the emperor, Lollius undertook an invasion of southern [[Scotland]], winning some significant victories, and constructing the [[Antonine Wall]]<ref>Bowman, p. 152</ref> from the [[Firth of Forth]] to the [[Firth of Clyde]]. The wall, however, was soon gradually decommissioned during the mid-150s and eventually abandoned late during the reign (early 160s), for reasons that are still not quite clear.<ref name="Bowman, p. 155">Bowman, p. 155</ref><ref>David Colin Arthur Shotter, ''Roman Britain'', Abingdon: Routledge, 2004, ISBN 0-415-31943-9, page 49</ref> Antonine's Wall is mentioned in just one literary source, Antoninus' biography in the [[Historia Augusta]]. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] makes a brief and confused mention of a war in Britain. In one inscription honoring Antoninus, erected by [[Legio II Augusta]], which participated in the building of the Wall, a [[The Bridgeness Slab|relief]] showing four naked prisoners, one of them beheaded, seems to stand for some actual warfare.<ref>Jean-Louis Voisin, "Les Romains, chasseurs de têtes". In: ''Du châtiment dans la cité. Supplices corporels et peine de mort dans le monde antique''. Table ronde de Rome (9-11 novembre 1982) Rome : École Française de Rome, 1984. pp. 241-293.

Although Antonine's Wall was, in principle, much shorter and at first sight more defensible than Hadrian's Wall, the additional area that it enclosed within the Empire was barren, with the effect that supply lines to it were strained enough that the costs from maintaining the additional territory outweighed the benefits of doing so.<ref>Peter Spring, ''Great Walls and Linear Barriers''. Barnsley: Pen & Sword, 2015, ISBN 978-1-84884-377-6, page 75</ref> It has been therefore speculated that the invasion of Lowland Scotland and the building of the wall had to do mostly with internal politics, that is, offering Antoninus an opportunity to gain some modicum of necessary military prestige at the start of his reign. Actually, the campaign in Britannia was followed by an Imperial salutation - that is, by Antoninus formally taking for the second (and last) time the title of [[Imperator]] - in 142.<ref>David J. Breeze, ''Roman Frontiers in Britain''. London: Bloomsbury, 2013, ISBN 978-1-8539-9698-6, page 53</ref> The fact that around the same time coins were struck announcing a victory in Britain points to Antoninus' need to publicize his achievements.<ref>Salway, 149</ref> The orator [[Fronto]] was later to say that, although Antoninus bestowed the direction of the British campaign to others, he should be regarded as the helmsman who directed the voyage, whose glory, therefore, belonged to him.<ref>Anthony Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', London: Routledge, 2012, ISBN 0-415-17125-3, page 61</ref>

That this quest for some military achievement responded to an actual need, is proved by the fact that, although generally peaceful, Antoninus' reign was not free from attempts of usurpation: [[Historia Augusta]] mentions two, made by senators Cornelius Priscianus (by the way, Lollius Urbicus' successor as governor of Britain) and Atilius Rufius Titianus - both confirmed by the [[Fasti Ostienses]] as well as by the erasing of Priscianus' name from an inscription <ref>Albino Garzetti, ''From Tiberius to the Antonines: A History of the Roman Empire AD 14-192''. London: Routledge, 2014, ISBN 978-1-138-01920-1, page 447; [[Paul Veyne]], ''L'Empire Gréco-Romain'', Paris: Seuil, 2005, ISBN 2-02-057798-4, page 28, footnote 61; Salway, 149</ref> In both cases, Antoninus was not in formal charge of the ensuing repression: Priscianus committed suicide and Titianus was found guilty by the Senate, with Antoninus abstaining from sequestering their families' properties<ref>Marta García Morcillo, ''Las ventas por subasta en el mundo romano: la esfera privada''. Edicions Universitat Barcelona, 2005, ISBN 84-475-3017-5, page 301</ref>

There were also some troubles in [[Dacia Inferior]] which required the granting of additional powers to the [[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]] governor and the dispatchment of additional soldiers to the province.<ref name="Bowman, p. 155">Bowman, p. 155</ref> On the Northern [[Black Sea]] coast, the Greek city of [[Olbia, Ukraine|Olbia]] was held against the [[Scythians]].<ref>Gocha R. Tsetskhladze, ed., ''North Pontic Archaeology: Recent Discoveries and Studies''. Leiden: Brill, 2001, ISBN 90-04-12041-6, page 425</ref> Also during his reign the governor of [[Upper Germany]], probably Caius Popillius Carus Pedo, built new fortifications in the [[Agri Decumates]], advancing the [[Limes Germanicus]] fifteen miles forward in his province and neighboring [[Raetia]].<ref>Birley, p. 113</ref> In the East, Roman suzerainty over [[Armenia]] was retained by the 140 choosing of [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid]] scion [[Sohaemus of Armenia|Sohaemus]] as client king.<ref>Rouben Paul Adalian, ''Historical Dictionary of Armenia'', Lanham: Scarecrow, 2010, ISBN 978-0-8108-6096-4, entry "Arshakuni/Arsacid", page 174</ref>

Nevertheless, Antoninus was virtually unique among emperors in that he dealt with these crises without leaving Italy once during his reign,<ref>Speidel, Michael P., ''Riding for Caesar: The Roman Emperors' Horse Guards'', Harvard University Press, 1997, p. 50; Canduci, p. 40</ref> but instead dealt with provincial matters of war and peace through their governors or through imperial letters to the cities such as Ephesus (of which some were publicly displayed). This style of government was highly praised by his contemporaries and by later generations.<ref>See Victor, 15:3</ref>

Antoninus was the last Roman Emperor recognised by the Indian Kingdoms. Raoul McLaughlin quotes Aurelius Victor as saying " The Indians, the Bactrians and the Hyrcanians all sent ambassadors to Antoninus. They had all heard about the spirit of justice held by this great emperor, justice that was heightened by his handsome and grave countenance, and his slim and vigorous figure." Due to the outbreak of the Antonine epidemic and wars against northern Germanic tribes, the reign of Marcus Aurelius was forced to alter the focus of foreign policies and matters of the Far East was increasingly abandoned in favour of those directly concerning the Empire's survival.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McLaughlin|first1=Raoul|title=Books on Google Play.

===Economy and Administration===
[[File:Aureus d'Antonin le Pieux.jpg|thumb|An [[aureus]] of Antoninus Pius, 145 AD]]
Antoninus was regarded as a skilled administrator and as a builder. In spite of an extensive building directive - the free access of the people of Rome to drinking water was expanded with the construction of aqueducts, not only in Rome but throughout the Empire, as well as bridges and roads, the Emperor still managed to leave behind a sizable public treasure of around two and a half million [[Sestertius|sesterces]] (Rome would not witness another Emperor leaving his successor with a surplus for a long time. But this treasure was depleted almost immediately after Antoninus's reign due to the plagues the troops brought back after the Parthian victory<ref>{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Timothy F. H.|last2=Hoekstra|first2=Thomas W.|last3=Tainter|first3=Joseph A.|title=Supply-Side Sustainability|date=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231504072|pages=105-106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lQjb04tfBHsC&pg=PA106}}</ref>).

The Emperor also famously suspended the collection of taxes from cities affected by natural disasters, such as when fires struck Rome and Narbona, and earthquakes affected [[Rhodes]] and the [[Province of Asia]]. He offered hefty financial grants for rebuilding and recovery of various Greek cities after two serious earthquakes: the first, ''circa'' 140, which affected mostly Rhodes and other islands; the second, in 152, which hit [[Cyzicus]] - where the huge and newly built Temple to Hadrian was destroyed<ref>Barbara Burrell.

In his dealings with Greek-speaking cities, Antoninus followed the policy adopted by Hadrian of ingratiating himself with local elites, specially with local intellectuals: philosophers, teachers of literature, rhetoricians and physicians were explicitly exempted from any duties involving private spending for civic purposes - a privilege granted by Hadrian that Antoninus confirmed by means of an edict preserved in the [[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]] (27.1.6.8).<ref>Philip A.

Antoninus was known as an avid observer of rites of religion and of formal celebrations - both Roman and foreign. He is known for having increasingly formalized the official cult offered to the [[Cybele|Great Mother]], which from his reign onwards included a bull sacrifice, a [[taurobolium]], formerly only a private ritual, now being also performed for the sake of the Emperor's welfare.<ref>Gary Forsythe, ''Time in Roman Religion: One Thousand Years of Religious History''.

Antoninus tried to portray himself as a magistrate of the ''res publica'', no matter how extended and ill-defined his competences were: therefore the fact that he is credited with the splitting of the imperial treasure, the [[Fiscus]]. This splitting had to do with the division of Imperial properties into two parts: firstly, the fiscus itself-or ''patrimonium'', meaning the properties of the "Crown", the hereditary properties of each succeeding person that sat on the throne, transmitted to his successors in office,<ref>''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', London: 2012, ISBN 978-0-19-954556-8, entry "Patrimonium".</ref> regardless of their being members of the imperial family or not;<ref>After the death of [[Nero]], the personal properties of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] had been appropriated by the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavians]], and therefore turned into public properties: Carrié & Roussele, 586</ref> secondly, the ''res privata'', the "private" properties tied to the personal maintenance of the Emperor and his family.<ref>Carrié & Rousselle, 586</ref> An anecdote in the [[Historia Augusta]] biography, where Antoninus replies to Faustina - who complained about his stinginess - that "we have gained an empire [and] lost even what we had before" possibly relates to Antoninus' actual concerns at the creation of the ''res privata''.<ref>''The Cambridge Ancient History Volume 11: The High Empire, AD 70–192''. Cambridge U.P., 2009, ISBN 9780521263351, page 150</ref> While still a private citizen, Antoninus had increased his personal fortune greatly by mean of various legacies, the consequence - we are told - of his caring scrupulously for his relatives.<ref>Edward Champlin, ''Final Judgments: Duty and Emotion in Roman Wills, 200 B.C.-A.D. 250''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991, ISBN 0-520-07103-4, page 98</ref>

The ''res privata'' lands could be sold and/or given away, while the ''patrimonium'' properties were regarded as public.<ref>David S. Potter, ''The Roman Empire at Bay''. London: Routledge, 2014, ISBN 978-0-415-84054-5, page 49</ref> It was a way of pretending that the Imperial function - and most properties attached to it - was a public one, formally subject to the authority of the Senate and the Roman people.<ref>Heinz Bellen, "Die 'Verstaatlichung' des Privatvermögens der römische Kaiser". Hildegard Temporini, ed., ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'', Berlin: De Gruyter, 1974, ISBN 3-11-004571-0, page 112</ref> That the distinction played no part in subsequent political history - that the ''personal'' power of the princeps absorbed his role as office-holder - proves that the autocratic logic of the imperial order had already subsumed the old republican institutions.<ref>Aloys Winterling, ''Politics and Society in Imperial Rome''. Malden, MA: John Wiley & sons, 2009, ISBN 978-1-4051-7969-0, pages 73/75</ref>

Of the public transactions of this period there is only the scantiest of information, but, to judge by what is extant, those twenty-two years were not remarkably eventful in comparison to those before and after the reign. However, Antoninus did take a great interest in the revision and practice of the law throughout the empire.<ref name="Bury, p. 526">Bury, p. 526</ref> One of his chief concerns was to having local communities conform their legal procedures to existing Roman norms: in a case concerning repression of banditry by local police officers ("irenarchs") in Asia Minor, Antoninus ordered that these officers should not treat suspects as already condemned, and also keep a detailed copy of their interrogations, to be used in the possibility of an appeal to the Roman governor.<ref>Clifford Ando, ''Imperial Rome AD 193 to 284: The Critical Century''. Edinburgh University Press, 2012, ISBN 978-0-7486-2050-0, page 91</ref> Also, although Antoninus was not an innovator, he would not always follow the absolute letter of the law; rather he was driven by concerns over humanity and equality, and introduced into [[Roman law]] many important new principles based upon this notion.<ref name="Bury, p. 526">Bury, p. 526</ref>

In this, the emperor was assisted by five chief lawyers: L. Fulvius Aburnius Valens, an author of legal treatises;<ref>John Anthony Crook, ''Consilium Principis: Imperial Councils and Counsellors from Augustus to Diocletian'. Cambridge U.P.: 1955, page 67</ref> L. Ulpius Marcellus, a prolific writer; and three others .<ref name="Bury, p. 526">Bury, p. 526</ref> These last three included L. Volusius Maecianus, a former military officer turned by Antoninus into a civil procurator, and who, in view of his subsequent career (discovered on the basis of epigraphical and prosopographical research) was the Emperor's most important legal adviser.<ref>A. Arthur Schiller, ''Roman Law: Mechanisms of Development''. The Hague: Mouton, 1978, ISBN 90-279-7744-5, page 477</ref> Maecianus would eventually be chosen to occupy various prefectures (see below) as well as to conduct the legal studies of Marcus Aurelius. He was also the author of a large work on Fidei Commissa (Testamentary Trusts). As a hallmark of the increased connection between jurists and the imperial government,<ref>George Mousourakis, ''Roman Law and the Origins of the Civil Law Tradition'', Heidelberg: Springer, ISBN 978-3-319-12267-0, page 79</ref> Antoninus' reign also saw the appearance of the ''Institutes of Gaius'', an elementary legal manual for beginners (see [[Gaius (jurist)]]).<ref name="Bury, p. 526">Bury, p. 526</ref>

Antoninus passed measures to facilitate the [[enfranchisement]] of [[slavery|slaves]].<ref name="Bury, p. 527">Bury, p. 527</ref> Mostly, he favoured the principle of ''favor libertatis'', giving the putative freedman the benefit of the doubt when the claim to freedom was not clearcut.<ref>Keith Bradley, ''Slavery and Society at Rome''.

Paris: Seuil 1999, ISBN 2-02-025819-6, page 290</ref> In criminal law, Antoninus introduced the important principle that accused persons are [[Presumption of innocence|not to be treated as guilty before trial]]<ref name="Bury, p. 527">Bury, p. 527</ref>- as in the case of the irenarchs (see above). He also asserted the principle that the trial was to be held, and the punishment inflicted, in the place where the crime had been committed. He mitigated the use of [[torture]] in examining slaves by certain limitations. Thus he prohibited the application of torture to children under fourteen years, though this rule had exceptions.<ref name="Bury, p. 527">Bury, p. 527</ref> However, it must be stressed that Antoninus ''extended'', by means of a [[rescript]], the use of torture as a means of obtaining evidence to pecuniary cases, when it had been applied up until then only in criminal cases.<ref>[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]], 48.18.9, as quoted by Edward Peters, ''Torture'', Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996, ISBN 0-8122-1599-0, page 29</ref> Also, already at the time torture of free men of low status (''humiliores'') had become legal, as proved by the fact that Antoninus exempted town councillors expressly from it, and also free men of high rank (''honestiores'') in general.<ref>Grant, 154/155.</ref>

One highlight during his reign occurred in 148, with the nine-hundredth anniversary of the foundation of [[Rome]] being celebrated by the hosting of magnificent games in Rome.<ref>Bowman, pg, 154</ref> It lasted a number of days, and a host of exotic animals were killed, including elephants, giraffes, tigers, rhinoceroses, crocodiles and hippopotami. While this increased Antoninus’s popularity, the frugal emperor had to debase the [[Roman currency]]. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 89% to 83.5% — the actual silver weight dropping from 2.88&nbsp;grams to 2.68&nbsp;grams.<ref name="Bowman, p. 155">Bowman, p. 155</ref><ref>[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm Tulane University "Roman Currency of the Principate"]{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref>

Scholars place Antoninus Pius as the leading candidate for fulfilling the role as a friend of Rabbi [[Judah haNasi|Judah the Prince]]. According to the [[Talmud]] (Avodah Zarah 10a-b), Rabbi Judah was very wealthy and greatly revered in Rome. He had a close friendship with "Antoninus", possibly Antoninus Pius,<ref>A. Mischcon, Abodah Zara, p.10a Soncino, 1988. Mischcon cites various sources, "SJ Rappaport... is of opinion that our Antoninus is Antoninus Pius." Other opinions cited suggest "Antoninus" was [[Caracalla]], [[Lucius Verus]] or [[Alexander Severus]].</ref> who would consult Rabbi Judah on various worldly and spiritual matters.

===Death===

In 156, Antoninus Pius turned 70. He found it difficult to keep himself upright without [[corset|stays]]. He started nibbling on dry bread to give him the strength to stay awake through his morning receptions. Marcus Aurelius had already been created consul with Antoninus in 140, receiving the title of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] - i.e., heir apparent.<ref>Geoffrey William Adams, ''Marcus Aurelius in the Historia Augusta and Beyond''.

However, it seems that this was not the case: according to his [[Historia Augusta]] biography (which seems to reproduce an earlier, detailed report) Antoninus' body (and not his ashes) was buried in [[Castel Sant'Angelo|Hadrian's mausoleum]]. After a seven-day interval (''justitium''), Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification.<ref>Robert Turcan, "Origines et sens de l'inhumation à l'époque impériale".

The only intact account of his life handed down to us is that of the ''[[Augustan History]]'', an unreliable and mostly fabricated work. Nevertheless, it still contains information that is considered reasonably sound – for instance, it is the only source that mentions the erection of the Antonine Wall in Britain.<ref>Historia Augusta, ''Life of Antoninus Pius'' 5:4</ref> Antoninus is unique among Roman emperors in that he has no other biographies. Historians have therefore turned to public records for what details we know.

===In later scholarship===
Antoninus in many ways was the ideal of the landed gentleman praised not only by ancient Romans, but also by later scholars of classical history, such as [[Edward Gibbon]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Edward|title=Delphi Complete Works of Edward Gibbon (Illustrated)|date=2015|publisher=Delphi Classics|isbn=9781910630761|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FB4BgAAQBAJ&pg=PT125}}</ref> or the author of the article on Antoninus Pius in the ninth edition of the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica]]:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chrisholm|first1=Hugh|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Volumes 1-2|date=1911|publisher=University Press|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fs09AQAAMAAJ&q=%22For+Antoninus+came+to+his+new+%22&dq=%22For+Antoninus+came+to+his+new+%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-1_as6rPPAhUdSY8KHZ4aCy8Q6AEIRDAJ}}</ref>

{{quote|A few months afterwards, on Hadrian's death, he was enthusiastically welcomed to the throne by the Roman people, who, for once, were not disappointed in their anticipation of a happy reign. For Antoninus came to his new office with simple tastes, kindly disposition, extensive experience, a well-trained intelligence and the sincerest desire for the welfare of his subjects. Instead of plundering to support his prodigality, he emptied his private treasury to assist distressed provinces and cities, and everywhere exercised rigid economy (hence the nickname κυμινοπριστης "cummin-splitter"). Instead of exaggerating into treason whatever was susceptible of unfavorable interpretation, he turned the very conspiracies that were formed against him into opportunities for demonstrating his clemency. Instead of stirring up persecution against the Christians, he extended to them the strong hand of his protection throughout the empire. Rather than give occasion to that oppression which he regarded as inseparable from an emperor's progress through his dominions, he was content to spend all the years of his reign in Rome, or its neighbourhood.}}
Some historians have a less positive view of his reign. According to the historian [[J. B. Bury]], {{quote|however estimable the man, Antoninus was hardly a great statesman. The rest which the Empire enjoyed under his auspices had been rendered possible through Hadrian’s activity, and was not due to his own exertions; on the other hand, he carried the policy of peace at any price too far, and so entailed calamities on the state after his death. He not only had no originality or power of initiative, but he had not even the insight or boldness to work further on the new lines marked out by Hadrian.<ref>Bury, p. 524</ref>}}

German historian [[Ernst Kornemann]] has had it in his ''Römische Geschichte'' [2 vols., ed. by H. Bengtson, Stuttgart 1954] that the reign of Antoninus comprised "a succession of grossly wasted opportunities," given the upheavals that were to come. There is more to this argument, given that the Parthians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Antoninus' passing. Kornemann's brief is that Antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders. [[Michael Grant (author)|Micheal Grant]] agrees that it is possible that had Antoninus acted decisively sooner (it appears on his death bed, he was preparing a large scale action against the Parthians), the Parthians might have been unable to choose their own time, but current evidences are not conclusive. Grant opines that Antoninus and his officers did act in a resolute manner dealing with frontier disturbances of his time, although conditions for long lasting peace were not created. On the whole, according to Grant, Marcus Aurelius' eulogistic picture of Antoninus seems deserved, and Antonius appears to have been a conservative and nationalistic (although he respected and followed Hadrian's example of Philhellenism moderately) Emperor who was not tainted by the blood of either citizen or foe, combined and maintained Numa Pompilius' good fortune, pacific dutifulness and religious scrupulousness, and whose laws removed anomalies and soften harshnesses.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Michael|title=The Antonines: The Roman Empire in Transition|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317972112|pages=14-23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-FwfDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT28}}</ref>

Krzysztof Ulanowski argues that the claims of military inability is exaggerated, considering that although the sources praise Antoninus' love for peace and his efforts 'rather to defend, than enlarge the provinces', he could hardly be considered a pacifist, as shown by the conquest of the Lowlands, the building of the Antonine Wall and the expansion of Germania Superior. Ulianowski also praises Antoninus for being successful in deterrence by diplomatic means.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ulanowski|first1=Krzysztof|title=The Religious Aspects of War in the Ancient Near East, Greece, and Rome: Ancient Warfare Series, Volume 1|date=2016|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004324763|pages=360–361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KX6kDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA358}}</ref>

Although only one of his four children survived to adulthood, Antoninus came to be ancestor to generations of prominent Roman statesmen and socialites, including at least one empress consort and as the maternal grandfather of the Emperor [[Commodus]]. The family of Antoninus Pius and [[Faustina the Elder]] also represents one of the few periods in ancient Roman history where the position of Emperor passed smoothly from father to son. Direct descendants of Antoninus and Faustina were confirmed to exist at least into the fifth century AD.
