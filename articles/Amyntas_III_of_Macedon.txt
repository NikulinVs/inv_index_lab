'''Amyntas III''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Ἀμύντας Γ΄; died 370 BC) was a Macedonian king of [[Macedon]] in 393 BC, and again from 392 to 370 BC. He was the son of Arrhidaeus and grandson of Amyntas, one of the sons of [[Alexander I of Macedon|Alexander I]].<ref name="companion_ch8">{{Citation | last = Roisman  | first = Joseph  | contribution = Classical Macedonia to Perdiccas III  | year = 2010 | title = A Companion to Ancient Macedonia | editor1-last  = Roisman | editor1-first = Joseph | editor2-last = Worthington  | editor2-first = Ian | pages = 145–165| publication-date = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-4051-7936-2 | publisher = Blackwell Publishing}}</ref> His most famous son is [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], father of [[Alexander the Great]]. He is historically considered the founder of the unified Macedonian state.

== Reign ==
He came to the throne after the ten years of confusion which followed the death of [[Archelaus I of Macedon|Archelaus I]]. But he had many enemies at home; in 393 he was driven out by the [[Illyria]]ns, but in the following year, with the aid of the [[Thessalia]]ns, he recovered his kingdom. Medius, head of the house of the [[Aleuadae]] of [[Larissa]], is believed to have provided aid to Amyntas in recovering his throne.  The mutual relationship between the [[Argead dynasty|Argeadae]] and the Aleuadae dates to the time of Archelaus.

To shore up his country against the threat of the Illyrians, Amyntas established an alliance with the [[Chalkidian League]] led by [[Olynthus]].  In exchange for this support, Amyntas granted them rights to Macedonian timber, which was sent back to Athens to help fortify their fleet. With [[money]] flowing into Olynthus from these exports, their power grew. In response, Amyntas sought additional allies. He established connections with [[Cotys I (Odrysian)|Kotys]], chief of the [[Odrysians]]. Kotys had already married his daughter to the Athenian general [[Iphicrates]].  Prevented from marrying into Kotys' family, Amyntas soon adopted Iphicrates as his son.

After the King's Peace 387 BC, [[History of Sparta|Sparta]] was anxious to re-establish its presence in the north of Greece.  In 385 BC, [[Bardylis]] and his [[Illyrians]] attacked [[Epirus]] instigated and aided by [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]],<ref>''A History of Greece to 322 B.C.'' by N. G. L. Hammond. ISBN 0-19-873095-0, 1986, page 479, "Molossi, Alcetas, who was a refugee at his court, Dionysius sent a supply of arms and 2,000 troops to the Illyrians, who burst into Epirus and slaughtered 15,000 Molossians. Sparta intervened as soon as they had learned of the events and expelled the Illyrians, but Alcetas had regained his..."</ref> in an attempt to restore the [[Molossian]] king [[Alcetas I of Epirus]] to the throne.  When Amyntas sought Spartan aid against the growing threat of Olynthus, the Spartans eagerly responded.  That Olynthus was backed by Athens and Thebes, rivals to Sparta for the control of Greece, provided them with an additional incentive to break up this growing power in the north.  Amyntas thus concluded a treaty with the Spartans, who assisted him to reduce [[Olynthus]] (379).  He also entered into a league with [[Jason of Pherae]], and assiduously cultivated the friendship of [[Athens]]. In 371 BC at a Panhellenic congress of the [[Lacedaemonian]] allies, he voted in support of the [[Athenians]]' claim and joined other Greeks in voting to help Athens to recover possession of [[Amphipolis]].<ref>[[Aeschines]] - On the Embassy [http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/aeschines-embassy.html 2.32]</ref><ref>History of Greece [https://books.google.com/books?id=5hcPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA336&dq=371+BC+Amyntas+Amphipolis#PPA339,M1] by George Grote</ref>

With Olynthus defeated, Amyntas was now able to conclude a treaty with Athens and keep the timber revenues for himself. Amyntas shipped the timber to the house of the Athenian [[Timotheus (general)|Timotheus]], in the [[Piraeus]].

== Family ==

Amyntas married [[Eurydice I of Macedon|Eurydice]], daughter of [[Sirras|Sirras of Lynkestis]], circa 390.<ref name="women_macedonia">{{cite book|last1=Carney|first1=Elizabeth|title=Women and Monarchy in Macedonia|date=2000|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0-8061-3212-4}}</ref> By her, Amyntas had three sons, all of whom became kings of Macedonia one after the other, and a daughter:
*[[Alexander II of Macedon|Alexander II]]
*[[Perdiccas III of Macedon|Perdiccas III]]
*[[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], father of [[Alexander the Great]]. 
*Eurynoe: According to Roman historian [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], Eurynoe prevented Amyntas' assassination by her mother and her husband (thought to be [[Ptolemy of Aloros]]), who was also her mother's lover, by revealing the plan to her father. She is not referred again by any other source.<ref name="women_macedonia" />

Justin also mentions that Amyntas had three sons by another wife, Gygaea (probably an Argead): Archelaus, Arrhidaeus and Menelaus. The fact that they did not try to take the throne before the 350s suggests that they were younger than Amyntas' children by Eurydice. They were ultimately eliminated by their half-brother Philip II because they had a claim to the throne.<ref name="women_macedonia" />

Amyntas died at an advanced age, leaving his throne to his eldest son, Alexander II.
