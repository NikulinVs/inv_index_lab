==Biography==
[[File:Polish sci fi fantasy books.JPG|thumb|upright|Sapkowski [[novel]]s on display at an [[Empik]] store in [[Katowice]], [[Poland]]]]
Sapkowski studied economics, and before turning to writing, he had worked as a senior sales representative for a foreign trade company. He started his literary career as a translator, in particular, of science fiction. He says he wrote his first [[short story]], "[[The Witcher]]" ("Wiedźmin", also translated "The Hexer" or "Spellmaker") on a whim, in order to enter a contest by Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine ''[[Fantastyka]]''. Being an expert in marketing{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}, he says he knew how to sell, and indeed, he won the 3rd prize.<ref>[http://www.mirf.ru/Articles/art934.htm http://www.mirf.ru/Articles/art934.htm НО МЫ ЖЕ СЛАВЯНЕ! РАЗГОВОР С АНДЖЕЕМ САПКОВСКИМ], An interview with Sapkowski for Russian monthly magazine "World of Fatnastics"</ref> The story was published in ''Fantastyka'' in 1986 and  was enormously successful both with readers and critics. Sapkowski has created a [[Novel sequence|cycle of tales]] based on the world of "The Witcher", comprising three collections of short stories and five novels. This cycle and his many other works have made him one of the best-known [[fantasy author]]s in Poland in the 1990s.<ref name=mo/>

The main character of "The Witcher" is [[Geralt of Rivia|Geralt]], a [[mutant]] hunter who has been trained since childhood to hunt down and destroy monsters. Geralt exists in a morally ambiguous universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At the same time cynical and noble, Geralt has been compared to [[Raymond Chandler]]'s signature character [[Philip Marlowe]].<ref name=mo>{{pl icon}} Marek Oramus ''[http://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/jedynie-sluszny-wizerunek-wiedzmina,365834.html Jedynie słuszny wizerunek wiedźmina]'',  Polityka – nr 36 (2261) from 2000-09-02; pp. 52–54</ref> The world in which these adventures take place is heavily influenced by [[Slavic mythology]].<ref>''[http://www.fantasybookreview.co.uk/Andrzej-Sapkowski/The-Last-Wish.html The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski ]'', fantasybookreview</ref>

Sapkowski has won five [[Janusz A. Zajdel Award|Zajdel Award]]s, including three for short stories "Mniejsze zło" ("Lesser Evil") (1990), "Miecz przeznaczenia" ("Sword of Destiny") (1992) and "W leju po bombie" ("In a Bomb Crater") (1993), and two for the novels, ''[[Krew elfów]]'' (''Blood of Elves'') (1994) and [[Narrenturm (novel)|''Narrenturm'']] (2002).  He also won the Spanish [[Ignotus Award]], best anthology, for ''The Last Wish'' in 2003, and for ''Muzykanci'' (''The Musicians''), best foreign short story, same year.

In 1997, Sapkowski won the prestigious [[Polityka's Passport]] award,<ref name="libraryThing">{{cite web
