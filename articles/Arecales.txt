'''Arecales''' is an [[order (biology)|order]] of [[flowering plant]]s. The order has been widely recognised only for the past few decades; until then, the accepted name for the order including these plants was [[Principes (botany)|Principes]].

== Taxonomy==

The [[Cronquist system]] of 1981 assigned the order to the subclass [[Arecidae]] in the class [[Liliopsida]] (= [[monocotyledons]]).

The [[Thorne system (1992)]] and the [[Dahlgren system]] assigned the order to the superorder Areciflorae, also called [[Arecanae]] in the subclass [[Liliidae]] (= monocotyledons), with the single family Arecaceae.

The [[APG II system]] of 2003 recognised the order and placed it in the clade [[commelinids]] in the [[monocots]] and uses this circumscription:

* order Arecales
*: family [[Arecaceae]], alternative name [[Palmae]]

This was unchanged from the [[APG system]] of 1998, although it used the spelling "commelinoids" instead of commelinids.

The [[APG IV system]] of 2016 places [[Dasypogonaceae]] in this order, after studies shown Dasypogonaceae as sister to Arecaceae.<ref name="apgiv">{{Citation |last=Angiosperm Phylogeny Group |year=2016 |title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG IV |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/boj.12385/full |accessdate=2016-04-01 |doi=10.1111/boj.12385}}</ref>
