}}'''Alfons Maria Jakob''' (2 July 1884 in [[Aschaffenburg]]/[[Bavaria]] &ndash; 17 October 1931 in [[Hamburg]]) was a German [[neurologist]] who worked in the field of [[neuropathology]].

He was born in [[Aschaffenburg]], [[Bavaria]] and educated in [[medicine]] at the universities of [[University of Munich|Munich]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]], where he received his doctorate in 1908. During the following year, he began clinical work under the [[psychiatrist]] [[Emil Kraepelin]] and did laboratory work with [[Franz Nissl]] and [[Alois Alzheimer]] in [[Munich]].<ref name=WN>[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/738.html Alfons Maria Jakob] at [[Who Named It]]</ref>

In 1911, by way of an invitation from [[Wilhelm Weygandt]],<ref name=NE>[https://books.google.com/books?id=JIkqCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT422&lpg=PT422&dq=%22Alfons+Maria+Jakob%22+1884&source=bl&ots=cWpu4-Qd3g&sig=ypftuqt9gBRY4AB44Fbo4mH4GII&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjrvZCM3qLLAhVqsoMKHQGvBBs4ChDoAQgtMAM#v=onepage&q=%22Alfons%20Maria%20Jakob%22%201884&f=false Neurological Eponyms] edited by Peter J. Koehler, George W. Bruyn, John M. S. Pearce</ref> he relocated to [[Hamburg]], where he worked with [[Theodor Kaes]] and eventually became head of the laboratory of [[anatomical pathology]] at the psychiatric State Hospital Hamburg-Friedrichsberg. Following the death of Kaes in 1913, Jakob succeeded him as [[prosector]].<ref name=WN/> During [[World War I]] he served as an army physician in [[Belgium]],<ref name=NE/> and afterwards returned to Hamburg. In 1919 he obtained his [[habilitation]] for [[neurology]] and in 1924 became a professor of neurology. Under Jakob's guidance the department grew rapidly. He made significant contributions to knowledge on [[concussion]] and secondary nerve degeneration and became a doyen of [[neuropathology]].<ref name=WH>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-TGgBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=%22Alfons+Maria+Jakob%22+1884&source=bl&ots=LtqjFg23Fr&sig=3UCfnUch2px79KIN-MOocNcIZS8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWvJ2f6aLLAhXmyIMKHUZrCRw4ChDoAQgvMAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Alfons%20Maria%20Jakob%22%201884&f=false The Man Behind the Syndrome] by Greta Beighton</ref>

Jakob was the author of five monographs and nearly 80 scientific papers.<ref name=NE/> His neuropathological research contributed greatly to the delineation of several diseases, including [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Friedreich's ataxia]]. He first recognised and described [[Alper's disease]] and [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (named along with Munich neuropathologist [[Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt]]).<ref name=WN/> He gained experience in [[neurosyphilis]], having a 200-bed ward devoted entirely to that disorder. Jakob made a lecture tour of the United States (1924) and South America (1928), of which, he wrote a paper on the neuropathology of [[yellow fever]].<ref name=WH/><ref name=NE/>

He suffered from chronic [[osteomyelitis]] for the last seven years of his life. This eventually caused a retroperitoneal [[abscess]] and [[Paralysis|paralytic]] [[ileus]] from which he died following operation.<ref name=WN/>
