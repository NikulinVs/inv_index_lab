An '''alphabet song''' is any of various songs used to teach children the [[alphabet]]. Alphabet songs typically follow the [[alphabetic principle]] (though the [[phonics]] method offers variants). In languages such as [[English language|English]] with [[morphophonemic]] variation (e.g. "c'''a'''ke" is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|k}}, not {{IPA|[ˈkaːkɛ]}}), an alphabet song usually chooses a particular [[pronunciation]] for each letter in the alphabet and also typically for some words in the song.

== The A.B.C. (Verse 1) ==
"The A.B.C." {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|ˌ|b|iː|ˈ|s|iː}} or "A.B.Cs" {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|ˌ|b|iː|ˈ|s|iː|z}} is one of the best-known [[English language]] alphabet songs, and perhaps the one most frequently referred to as "the alphabet song", especially in the [[United States]].

The song was first copyrighted in 1835 by the [[Boston]]-based music publisher [[Charles Bradlee]], and given the title "The A.B.C., a German air with variations for the flute with an easy accompaniment for the piano forte". The musical arrangement was attributed to [[Louis Le Maire]] (sometimes Lemaire), an 18th-century composer. This was "Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1835, by C. Bradlee, in the clerk's office of the District Court of Massachusetts", according to the Newberry Library,<ref>[http://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First  Newberry Library catalog]</ref> which also says, "The theme is that used by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] for his [[Twelve Variations on "Ah vous dirai-je, Maman"|piano variations, Ah, vous dirai-je, maman]]."<ref>The alphabet song is sometimes said to come from another of Bradlee's publications, "The Schoolmaster", but the first line of that song is given as "Come, come my children, I must see", in [http://orbis.library.yale.edu [[Yale University]]'s library catalog].  It is described as "a favorite glee for three voices, as sung at the Salem glee club."</ref> This tune is the same as the tune for  "[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]" and "[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]".

=== Zed for Zee ===
In the [[United States]], [[Z]] is pronounced ''zee''; in most other English-speaking countries (such as Canada, the UK and Australia) it is pronounced ''zed''.  Generally, the absent ''zee''-rhyme is not missed, although some children use a ''zee'' pronunciation in the rhyme which they would not use elsewhere. Variants of the song exist to accommodate the ''zed'' pronunciation.  One variation shortens the second line and lengthens the last, to form a near-rhyme between [[N]] and zed:

Alternate Zed Version:

:''a-b-c-d''
:''e-f-g''
:''h-i-j-k''
:''l-m-n''
:''o-p-q-r''
:''s-t-u''
:''v-w-x-y-z(ed)''

Another alternate Zed version:{{citation needed|reason=can't see how this grouping could fit the tune|date=December 2016}}

:''a-b-c, d-e-f''
:''g-h-i-j-k-l-m''
:''n-o-p, q-r-s''
:''t-u-v-w-x-y-z(ed)''

==== Dutch version ====

:''a-b-c-d-e-f-g''
:''h-i-j-k-l-m-n-o-p''
:''q-r-s-t-u-v-w''
:''x-y-z''
Note that the third line is lengthened and the fourth line is shortened, to compensate for the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] pronunciations.

==== French Canadian version ====

A French-language version of the song is also taught in Canada, with generally no alterations to the melody except in the final line that requires adjustment to accommodate the two-syllable pronunciation of the French ''y''.

== Phonics songs ==
Because the English language has 40 sounds and only 26 letters, children and beginning readers also need to learn the different sounds (phonemes) associated with each letter. Many songs have been written to teach phonemic awareness and they are usually referred to as alphabet songs.

== Acrostic songs ==
There are also songs that go through the alphabet, making some of the letters stand for something in the process. An example was recorded in 1948, by [[Buddy Kaye]], [[Fred Wise (lyricist)|Fred Wise]], [[Sidney Lippman]], and later [[Perry Como]], called ''[[A, You're Adorable]]'' (also known as "The Alphabet Love Song"):

A newer example of this is from the musical ''[[Matilda the Musical|Matilda]]''. 'School Song' is an acrostic that spells out the alphabet phonetically.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/school-song-lyrics-matilda-london-cast.html|title=Matilda London Cast - School Song Lyrics {{!}} MetroLyrics|website=www.metrolyrics.com|access-date=2016-12-19}}</ref>

== Backwards song (Verse 2) ==
The group [[Wee Sing]] released an alphabet song with the letters in reverse order.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} It is called ZYXs.

The Canadian children's TV series ''[[The Big Comfy Couch]]'' used a version of the song in the episode "Backwards" (Season 4, episode 1.) {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Comedian [[Soupy Sales]] released a song in 1966 called "Backwards Alphabet" which contained the reverse alphabet in lyrical style.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The original version of the song was performed by actress Judi Rolin with The Smothers Brothers in the 1966 teleplay adaptation of ''Alice Through the Looking Glass''.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In the opening scene of the 1992 episode of ''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]'', Martin sings the song in the dark radio station in season 1's "Dead Men Don't Flush".
