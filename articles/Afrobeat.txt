'''Afrobeat''' is a music style which developed in the 1970s out of a combination of [[West African music|West African musical styles]], such as [[highlife]] and [[Yoruba music|yoruba]], with American [[funk]] and [[jazz]], with a focus on [[chant]]ed vocals<ref name="rebel" /> and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]. It was created by Nigerian [[multi-instrumentalist]] and [[bandleader]] [[Fela Kuti]] who popularised the style both within and outside [[Nigeria]].<ref name="rebel">{{cite journal |last1=Grass  |first1=Randall F. |last2= |first2= |year= |title=Fela Anikulapo-Kuti: The Art of an Afrobeat Rebel |journal=The Drama Review: TDR |publisher=MIT Press |volume=30 |issue= |pages=131–148 |jstor=1145717 |doi= 10.2307/1145717}}</ref> 

Afrobeat, which is currently seen as the most popular form of music in Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon and other parts of Africa and the world, was partially borne out of an attempt to distinguish Kuti's music from the "[[soul music]]" of American artists such as [[James Brown]].<ref>[http://www.myjoyonline.com/entertainment/2015/october-22nd/fela-kuti-coined-afrobeat-in-accra-out-of-hate-for-james-brown-prof-john-collins.php]</ref> Afrobeat features [[chant]]s, [[call-and-response]] vocals, and complex, interacting rhythms.<ref name="rebel" />

The new sound hailed from a club that he established called the [[New Afrika Shrine|Afrika Shrine]]. Upon arriving in Nigeria, Kuti also changed the name of his group to Africa '70. The band maintained a five-year residency in the Afrika Shrine from 1970 to 1975 while afrobeat thrived among Nigerian youth. Afrobeat is now one of the most recognizable music genres in the world and has influenced as many Western musicians as it has African ones with its exuberant style and [[polyrhythm]]s.

==Origins==

Afrobeat originated from Fuji, heavy Nigerian drumbeats and [[highlife]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/ghana-soundz-afrobeat-funk-and-fusion-in-the-70s-mw0000259942|title=Ghana Soundz: Afrobeat, Funk and Fusion in the 70's - Various Artists - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|author=Chris Nickson|work=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldmusiccentral.org/2013/08/29/the-infectious-songs-of-ghanaian-afrobeat/|title=The Infectious Songs of Ghanaian Afrobeat|work=worldmusiccentral.org}}</ref> It was later exported to the southern part of [[Nigeria]] in the 1970s, Fela Kuti, experimented with many different forms of contemporary music of the time.<ref>{{cite web <!--| date=18 July 2012--> | author=Clyde Macfarlane |url=http://thinkafricapress.com/ghana/album-review-konkoma-afrobeat-highlife |title=Album Review: KonKoma |publisher=Think Africa Press |date=2012-07-18 |accessdate=2015-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhapsody.com/blog/post/radio-afrobeat-airwaves|title=Radio: AfroBeat Airwaves|work=Rhapsody}}</ref> Prevalent in his and [[Lagbaja]]'s music are native Nigerian harmonies and rhythms, taking different elements and combining, modernizing, and improvising upon them. [[Politics]] are essential to Afrobeat, since founder Kuti used social criticism to pave the way for social change. His message can be described as confrontational and controversial, which can be related to the political climate of most of the African countries in the 1970s, many of which were dealing with political injustice and military corruption while recovering from the transition from colonial governments to self-determination. As the genre spread throughout the African continent many bands took up the style. The recordings of these bands and their songs were rarely heard or exported outside the originating countries but many can now be found on [[compilation album]]s and [[CD]]s from specialist record shops.

==Influence==
Many [[jazz]] musicians have been attracted to afrobeat. From [[Roy Ayers]] in the 1970s to [[Randy Weston]] in the 1990s, there have been collaborations that have resulted in albums such as ''Africa: Centre of the World'' by Roy Ayers, released on the [[Polydor Records|Polydore]] label in 1981. In 1994 [[Branford Marsalis]], the American jazz saxophonist, included samples of Fela's "Beast of No Nation" on his ''[[Buckshot LeFonque (album)|Buckshot LeFonque]]'' album. The new generation of [[Disc Jockey|DJs]] and musicians of the 2000s who have fallen in love with both Kuti's material and other rare releases have made compilations and [[remix]]es of these recordings, thus re-introducing the genre to new generations of listeners and fans of [[Afro pop music|afropop]] and [[Groove (music)|groove]] (see [[#afrobeats|Afrobeats]] section below).

Afrobeat has profoundly influenced important contemporary producers and musicians like [[Brian Eno]] and [[David Byrne]], who credit Fela Kuti as an essential influence. Both worked on [[Talking Heads]]' highly acclaimed 1980 album ''[[Remain In Light]]'', which brought polyrhythmic afrobeat influences to Western music. More recently, the horn section of [[Antibalas]] have been guest musicians on [[TV On The Radio]]'s highly acclaimed 2008 album ''[[Dear Science]]'', as well as on British band [[Foals (band)|Foals]]' 2008 album, ''[[Antidotes]]''. Some Afrobeat influence can also be found in the music of [[Vampire Weekend]] and [[Paul Simon]].

===Afrobeats===
Afrobeats (a term also sometimes used to denote popular Nigerian and Ghanaian music, hiplife, or Afropop) is an emerging genre: drawing from broad continental and diasporic sounds.<ref name=":0">Dan Hancox, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/19/the-rise-of-afrobeats "The rise of Afrobeats"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 19 January 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26770178 Guide to Nigeria's Afrobeats stars]. By DJ Edu, [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]], 29 March 2014.</ref> The new genre seeks inspiration from Afrobeat, hiplife, R&B, house music, Jamaican dancehall, as well as various local musics.<ref>{{Cite web|title = It's Called Afrobeats And It's Taking Over London {{!}} Thump|url = http://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/its-called-afrobeats-not-afrobeat-and-its-taking-over-london|website = Thump|accessdate = 2015-11-30|language = en-US}}</ref> According to David Drake, the eclectic genre “reimagines diasporic influences and—more often than not—completely reinvents them.”<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pop Music's Nigerian Future|url = http://www.thefader.com/2014/08/01/pop-musics-nigerian-future|website = The FADER|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}</ref> However, some caution against equating Afrobeats to contemporary pan-African music, in order to prevent the erasure of local musical contributions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = At the crossroads of BET, Afrobeats, and #BlackLivesMatter|url = http://africasacountry.com/2015/07/at-the-crossroads-of-bet-afrobeats-and-blacklivesmatter/|website = Africa is a Country|accessdate = 2015-11-30|language = en-US}}</ref>

Afrobeats is primarily produced between [[Lagos]], [[Accra]], and [[London]]. [[Paul Gilroy]], of ''The Black Atlantic'', reflects on the changing London music scene as a result of shifting demographics:<blockquote>"We are moving towards an African majority which is diverse both in its cultural habits and in its relationship to colonial and postcolonial governance, so the shift away from Caribbean dominance needs to be placed in that setting. Most of the grime folks are African kids, either the children of migrants or migrants themselves. It's not clear what Africa might mean to them"<ref name=":0" /></blockquote>Many first and second generation African immigrants follow - and produce - Afrobeats music. Fuse ODG, a UK artist of Ghanaian descent, coins #TINA or This is New Africa as a means to change perceptions of Africa:<blockquote>"This movement will shed light on Africa in a positive way and focus on how we can improve Africa. It’s not about just plying your talents in the Western world; it’s about going back home and helping Africa."<ref name=":0" /></blockquote>

===International influence===
[[File:DrakeOneDance.png|thumb|Drake's 2016 single "One Dance" (featuring Wizkid and Kyla) was made with an afrobeat-inspired sound]]
