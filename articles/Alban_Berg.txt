==Biography==

===Early life===
Berg was born in [[Vienna]], the third of four children of Johanna and Conrad Berg. His family lived comfortably until the death of his father in 1900.

===Education===
He was more interested in [[literature]] than [[music]] as a child and did not begin to compose until he was fifteen, when he started to teach himself music. In late February or early March 1902 he fathered a child with Marie Scheuchl, a servant girl in the Berg family household. His daughter, Albine, was born on December 4, 1902.

Berg had little formal music education before he became a student of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] in October 1904. With Schoenberg he studied [[counterpoint]], [[music theory]], and [[harmony]].<ref>Schoenberg, Arnold. Trans. Joe Monzo. {{cite web |url=http://www.sonic-arts.org/monzo/schoenberg/harm/monzo-intro.htm |title="Schoenberg's Harmonielehre", ''Sonic Arts'' |dead-url=yes |accessdate=July 2016}}{{dead link|date=July 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> By 1906, he was studying music full-time; by 1907, he began [[musical composition|composition]] lessons. His student compositions included five drafts for [[piano sonata]]s. He also wrote songs, including his ''[[Seven Early Songs (Berg)|Seven Early Songs]]'' (''Sieben Frühe Lieder''), three of which were Berg's first publicly performed work in a concert that featured the music of Schoenberg's pupils in Vienna that year. The early sonata sketches eventually culminated in Berg's [[Piano Sonata (Berg)|Piano Sonata]], [[opus number|Op]]. 1 (1907–1908); it is one of the most formidable "first" works ever written.<ref>Lauder (1986)</ref> Berg studied with Schoenberg for six years until 1911. Berg admired him as a composer and mentor, and they remained close lifelong friends.

Among Schoenberg's teaching was the idea that the unity of a musical composition depends upon all its aspects being derived from a single basic idea; this idea was later known as ''developing variation''. Berg passed this on to his students, one of whom, [[Theodor W. Adorno]], stated: "The main principle he conveyed was that of variation: everything was supposed to develop out of something else and yet be intrinsically different".<ref>Adorno, p. 33</ref> The Piano Sonata is an example—the whole composition is derived from the work's opening [[quartal and quintal harmony|quartal]] gesture and its opening phrase.

===Innovation===
Berg was a part of Vienna's cultural elite during the heady ''[[fin de siècle]]'' period. His circle included the musicians [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]] and [[Franz Schreker]], the painter [[Gustav Klimt]], the writer and satirist [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], the architect [[Adolf Loos]], and the poet [[Peter Altenberg]]. In 1906, Berg met the singer [[Helene Nahowski]], daughter of a wealthy family (said by some to be in fact the illegitimate daughter of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] from his liaison with [[Anna Nahowski]]);<ref>Georg Markus, ''Der Kaiser Franz Joseph I.: Bilder und Dokumente''; Anna Nahowski and Friedrich Saathen, ''Anna Nahowski und Kaiser Franz Joseph : Aufzeichnungen / erstmalig herausgegeben und kommentiert von Friedrich Saathen'', Böhlau, 1986.</ref> despite the outward hostility of her family, the two were married on May 3, 1911.
[[File:Watschenkonzert Karikatur in Die Zeit vom 6. April 1913.jpg|thumb|''Watschenkonzert'', caricature in ''Die Zeit'' of April 6, 1913]]
In 1913, two of Berg's ''[[Altenberg Lieder|Five Songs on Picture Postcard Texts by Peter Altenberg]]'' (1912) were premièred in Vienna, [[conducting|conducted]] by Schoenberg in the infamous ''[[Skandalkonzert]]''. Settings of aphoristic poetic utterances, the songs are accompanied by a very large orchestra. The performance caused a riot, and had to be halted. This was a crippling blow to Berg's self-confidence: he effectively withdrew the work, which is surely{{Original research inline|date=March 2014}} one of his most innovative and assured first orchestral compositions in the literature, and it was not performed in full until 1952. The full score remained unpublished until 1966.

From 1915 to 1918, Berg served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] and during a period of leave in 1917 he accelerated work on his first [[opera]], ''[[Wozzeck]]''. After the end of [[World War I]], he settled again in Vienna, where he taught private pupils. He also helped Schoenberg run his [[Society for Private Musical Performances]], which sought to create the ideal environment for the exploration and appreciation of unfamiliar new music by means of open rehearsals, repeat performances, and the exclusion of professional critics.

Berg had a particular interest in the number 23, using it to structure several works.  Various suggestions have been made as to the reason for this interest: that he took it from the [[Biorhythms]] theory of [[Wilhelm Fliess]], in which a 23-day cycle is considered significant,<ref>Jarman, D. (1983). [http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/962034?uid=3738032&uid=373072751&uid=2&uid=3&uid=60&sid=21102523353593 Alban Berg, Wilhelm Fliess and the Secret Programme of the Violin Concerto]. ''The Musical Times'' Vol. 124, No. 1682 (Apr. 1983), pp. 218-223</ref> or because he first suffered an asthma attack on 23rd of the month.<ref>Jarman, D. (1985).

Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 228-230</ref>

===Success of ''Wozzeck'' and inception of ''Lulu'' 1925–29===
Three excerpts from ''Wozzeck'' were performed in 1924, and this brought Berg his first public success. The opera, which Berg completed in 1922, was first performed on December 14, 1925, when [[Erich Kleiber]] conducted the first performance in [[Berlin]]. Today ''Wozzeck'' is seen as one of the century's most important works. Berg made a start on his second opera, the three-act ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', in 1928 but interrupted the work in 1929 for the concert aria ''Der Wein'' which he completed that summer. ''Der Wein'' presaged ''Lulu'' in a number of ways, including vocal style, orchestration, design and text.{{sfn|Elliott|2014|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=qrkTAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA55 p.&nbsp;55]}}

Other well-known Berg compositions include the ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'' (1926), which was later shown to employ elaborate cyphers to document a secret love affair; the post-Mahlerian ''Three Pieces for Orchestra'' (completed in 1915 but not performed until after ''Wozzeck''); and the [[Kammerkonzert (Berg)|Chamber Concerto]] (''Kammerkonzert'', 1923–25) for violin, piano, and 13 wind instruments: this latter is written so conscientiously that Pierre Boulez has called it "Berg's strictest composition" and it, too, is permeated by cyphers and posthumously disclosed hidden programs.

===Final years 1930-35===
Life for the musical world was becoming increasingly difficult in the 1930s both in Vienna and Germany due to the rising tide of [[antisemitism]] and the [[Nazi]] cultural ideology that denounced [[modernity]]. Even to have an association with someone who was Jewish could lead to denunciation, and Berg's "crime" was to have studied with the Jewish composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. Berg found that opportunities for his work to be performed in Germany were becoming rare, and eventually his music was [[proscribed]] and placed on the list of [[degenerate music]].{{sfn|Notley|2010}} In 1932 Berg and his wife acquired an isolated lodge, the ''Waldhaus'' on the southern shore of the ''[[Wörthersee]]'', near [[Schiefling am See]] in [[Carinthia]], where he was able to work in seclusion, mainly on [[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]] and the [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]].{{sfn|Hailey|2010a}} At the end of 1934 Berg became involved in the political intrigues around finding a replacement for [[Clemens Krauss]] as director of the [[Vienna State Opera]]. As more of the performances of his work in Germany were cancelled by the [[Nazis]], who had come to power in early 1933, he needed to ensure the new director would be an advocate for modernist music. Originally the premiere of Lulu had been planned for the [[Berlin State Opera]], where [[Erich Kleiber]] continued to champion his music and had conducted the premiere of ''Wozzeck'' in 1925, but now this was looking increasingly uncertain, and Lulu was rejected by the Berlin authorities in the spring of 1934. Kleiber's production of the Lulu symphonic suite on 30 November 1934 in Berlin was also the occasion of his resignation in protest at the extent of conflation of culture with politics. Even in Vienna, the opportunities for the Vienna School of musicians was dwindling.{{sfn|Notley|2010}}

Berg had interrupted the orchestration of ''Lulu'' because of an unexpected (and financially much-needed) commission from the Russian-American violinist [[Louis Krasner]] for a [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] (1935). This profoundly elegiac work, composed at unaccustomed speed and posthumously premièred, has become Berg's best-known and beloved composition. Like much of his mature work, it employs an idiosyncratic adaptation of Schoenberg's "dodecaphonic" or [[twelve-tone technique]], that enables the composer to produce passages openly evoking tonality, including quotations from historical tonal music, such as a [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] chorale and a [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthian]] folk song. The Violin Concerto was dedicated "to the memory of an Angel", [[Manon Gropius]], the deceased daughter of architect [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Alma Mahler]].

Berg died in Vienna, on Christmas Eve 1935, from [[blood poisoning]] apparently caused by an insect-sting-induced [[carbuncle]] on his back that occurred in November.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Alban Berg|url = http://www.musicacademyonline.com/composer/biographies.php?bid=24|website = www.musicacademyonline.com|accessdate = 2015-09-17}}</ref>  He was 50 years old.

===Aftermath===
Berg completed the orchestration of only the first two acts of ''Lulu'' before he died. The first two acts were successfully premièred in Zürich in 1937, but for personal reasons Helene Berg subsequently imposed a ban on any attempt to "complete" the final act, which Berg had in fact completed in particell (short score) format. An orchestration was therefore commissioned in secret from [[Friedrich Cerha]] and premièred in Paris (under [[Pierre Boulez]]) only in 1979, soon after Helene Berg's own death. The complete opera has rapidly entered the repertoire as one of the landmarks of contemporary music and, like ''Wozzeck'', remains a consistent audience draw.
