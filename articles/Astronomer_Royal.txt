'''Astronomer Royal''' is a senior post in the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom]]. There are two officers, the senior being the Astronomer Royal dating from 22 June 1675; the second is the [[Astronomer Royal for Scotland]] dating from 1834.

The post was created by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1675, at the same time as he founded the [[Royal Observatory Greenwich]]. He appointed [[John Flamsteed]], instructing him "{{sic|hide=y|forthwith to apply himself with |the most exact care and diligence to the rectifying the tables of the motions of the heavens, and the places of the fixed stars, so as to find out the so-much desired longitude of places, for the perfecting the art of navigation}}."<ref>F Baily, "An Account of the Rev. John Flamsteed", reprinted in [https://books.google.com/books?id=48L1w21XYI4C&pg=PA293 vol.28,at p.293]. "The Museum of foreign literature, science and art", R Walsh et al., publ.

The Astronomer Royal was director of the Royal Observatory Greenwich from the establishment of the post in 1675 until 1972. The Astronomer Royal became an honorary title in 1972 without executive responsibilities and a separate post of [[Director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory]] was created to manage the institution.<ref name="mccrea_rgo_1975"/><ref name="meadows1975">{{cite book

The Astronomer Royal today receives a [[stipend]] of 100 [[Pound Sterling|GBP]] per year and is a member of the [[Royal Household]], under the general authority of the [[Lord Chamberlain]]. After the separation of the two offices, the position of Astronomer Royal has been largely honorary, though he remains available to advise the Sovereign on astronomical and related scientific matters, and the office is of great prestige.<ref name="monarchywebsite">{{cite web
