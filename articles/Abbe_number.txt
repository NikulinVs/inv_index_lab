Abbe_number.txt	In [[optics]] and [[lens design]], the '''Abbe number''', also known as the '''V-number''' or '''constringence''' of a [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] material, is a measure of the material's [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] (variation of [[refractive]] index versus wavelength), with high values of ''V'' indicating low dispersion. It is named after [[Ernst Abbe]] (1840–1905), the German physicist who defined it.

:<math>V_D = \frac{ n_D - 1 }{ n_F - n_C },</math>

where ''n''<sub>D</sub>, ''n''<sub>F</sub> and ''n''<sub>C</sub> are the refractive indices of the material at the wavelengths of the [[Fraunhofer lines|Fraunhofer]] D-, F- and C- [[spectral line]]s (589.3 [[nanometre|nm]], 486.1&nbsp;nm and 656.3&nbsp;nm respectively). 

Abbe numbers are used to classify [[glass]] and other optical materials in terms of their chromaticity. For example, the higher dispersion [[flint glass]]es have ''V''&nbsp;<&nbsp;55 whereas the lower dispersion [[crown glass (optics)|crown glass]]es have larger Abbe numbers. Values of ''V'' range from below 25 for very dense flint glasses, around 34 for [[polycarbonate]] plastics, up to 65 for common crown glasses, and 75 to 85 for some fluorite and phosphate crown glasses. 

[[File:Eyesensitivity.svg|thumb|Most of the human eye's wavelength sensitivity curve, shown here, is bracketted by the Abbe number reference wavelengths of 486.1&nbsp;nm (blue) and 656.3&nbsp;nm (red)]]Abbe numbers are used in the design of [[achromatic lens]]es, as their ''reciprocal'' is proportional to dispersion (slope of refractive index versus wavelength) in the wavelength region where the human eye is most sensitive (see graph). For different wavelength regions, or for higher precision in characterizing a system's chromaticity (such as in the design of [[apochromat]]s), the full dispersion relation (refractive index as a function of wavelength) is used.

An '''Abbe diagram''' is produced by plotting the Abbe number ''V''<sub>d</sub> of a material versus its refractive index ''n''<sub>d</sub>. Glasses can then be categorised and selected according to their positions on the diagram. This can be a letter-number code, as used in the [[Schott Glass]] catalogue, or a 6-digit [[glass code]].

Glasses' Abbe numbers, along with their mean refractive indices, are used in the calculation of the required [[refractive power]]s of the elements of [[achromatic lens#Design|achromatic]] [[lens (optics)|lenses]] in order to cancel [[chromatic aberration]] to first order. Note that these two parameters which enter into the equations for design of achromatic doublets are exactly what is plotted on an Abbe diagram.

Due to the difficulty and inconvenience in producing sodium and hydrogen lines, alternate definitions of the Abbe number are often substituted ([[ISO]] 7944).<ref>{{cite web|last=Meister|first=Darryl|title=Understanding Reference Wavelengths|url=http://www.opticampus.com/files/memo_on_reference_wavelengths.pdf|publisher=Carl Zeiss Vision|accessdate=2013-03-13}}</ref> Rather than the standard definition, above, using the refractive index variation between the F and C [[Fraunhofer lines#Naming|hydrogen lines]], an alternative measure using the subscript "e"
:<math> V_e = \frac{n_e-1}{ n_{F'} - n_{C'}}</math>
takes the difference between the refractive indices of the blue and red cadmium lines at 480.0&nbsp;nm and 643.8&nbsp;nm (with ''n<sub>e</sub>'' referring to the wavelength of the  mercury e-line, 546.073&nbsp;nm). Other definitions can similarly be employed; the following table lists standard wavelengths at which n is commonly determined, including the standard subscripts employed.<ref>L. D. Pye, V. D.
