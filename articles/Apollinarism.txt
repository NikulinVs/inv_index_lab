Apollinarism.txt	'''Apollinarism''' or '''Apollinarianism''' was a view proposed by [[Apollinaris of Laodicea]] (died 390) that [[Jesus]] could not have had a human mind; rather,  Jesus had a [[human]] body and lower soul (the seat of the emotions) but a [[God|divine]] mind. 

The [[Trinity]] had been recognized at the Council of Nicea in 325, but debate about exactly what it meant continued. A rival to the more common belief that Jesus Christ had two natures was [[monophysitism]] ("one nature"), the doctrine that Christ had only one nature. Apollinarism and [[Eutychianism]] were two forms of monophysitism. Apollinaris' rejection that Christ had a human mind was considered an over-reaction to [[Arianism]] and its teaching that Christ was not divine.<ref>McGrath, Alister. 1998.

[[Theodoret]] charged Apollinaris with confounding the persons of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]] and with giving in to the heretical ways of [[Sabellius]]. [[Basil of Caesarea]] accused him of abandoning the literal sense of the scripture, and taking up wholly with the allegorical sense. His views were condemned in a [[Synod]] at [[Alexandria]], under [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], in 362, and later subdivided into several different heresies, the main ones of which were the [[Polemian]]s and the [[Antidicomarianite]]s.

It was declared to be a [[Christian heresy|heresy]] in 381 by the [[First Council of Constantinople]], since Christ was officially depicted as fully human and fully God. Followers of Apollinarianism were accused of attempting to create a [[tertium quid]] ("third thing," neither God nor man).

Apollinaris further taught, following [[Tertullian]], that the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s of men were propagated by other souls, as well as their bodies (see [[traducianism]]). {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Christian philosopher [[William Lane Craig]] has proposed a neo-Apollinarian Christology in which the divine Logos completes the human nature of Christ. In doing so, Craig appears to be one of the only theologians who has attempted to provide a rational explanation for the phenomenon rather than simply affirming it as something to be accepted. Craig says his proposal is tentative and he welcomes critique and interaction from other scholars. While his views are neo-Apollinarian, they may be the only extent attempt to provide an account of the claim that Jesus of Nazareth was both fully human and fully divine. <ref>William Lane Craig and J.P.
