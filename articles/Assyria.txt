'''Assyria''' was a major [[Mesopotamia]]n [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic-speaking]] kingdom and [[empire]] of the [[ancient Near East]]. It existed as an independent state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC,<ref>Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq, p. 187</ref> until its   lapse between 612 BC and 599 BC, spanning the [[Early Bronze Age|Early]] to [[Middle Bronze Age]] through to the late [[Iron Age]].<ref name="edwards">{{cite book|title=Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 2, Part 2, History of the Middle East and the Aegean Region, c. 1380–1000 BC|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1975|pages=287–288, 298|chapter=Assyrian Military Power, 1300–1200 B.C.|author=[[Margaret Munn-Rankin|J.

Edwards}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The ancient Near East: historical sources in translation|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2006|pages=145–152|author=Christopher Morgan|editor=Mark William Chavalas}}</ref>

From the end of the seventh century BC to the mid-seventh century AD, it survived as a [[geopolitical]] entity, for the most part ruled by foreign powers, although the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] and its successor states arose at different times during the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and early [[Sasanian Empire]]s between the mid-second century BC and late third century AD, a period which also saw Assyria become a major centre of [[Syriac Christianity]] and the birthplace of the [[Church of the East]].<ref name="Winkler p. 1">Winkler, Church of the East: a concise history, p. 1</ref>

Centered on the [[Tigris]] in [[Upper Mesopotamia]] (modern northern [[Iraq]], northeastern [[Syria]], southeastern [[Turkey]] and the northwestern fringes of [[Iran]]), the Assyrians came to rule powerful empires at several times. Making up a substantial part of the greater Mesopotamian "[[cradle of civilization]]", which included [[Sumer]], the [[Akkadian Empire]], and [[Babylonia]], Assyria was at the height of technological, scientific and cultural achievements for its time. At its peak, the Assyrian empire stretched from [[Cyprus]] in the Mediterranean Sea to [[Iran]], and from what is now [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] in the [[Caucasus]], to the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Egypt]] and eastern [[Libya]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Assyrian Royal Inscriptions: Volume I | author = Albert Kirk Grayson | publisher = Otto Harrassowitz | location = Wiesbaden | year = 1972 | page = 108 }} §716.</ref>

Assyria is named after its original capital, the ancient city of [[Assur|Aššur]], which dates to c. 2600 BC, originally one of a number of Akkadian city states in Mesopotamia. In the 25th and 24th centuries BC, Assyrian kings were [[pastoral society|pastoral]] leaders. From the late 24th century BC, the Assyrians became subject to [[Sargon of Akkad]], who united all the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian-]] and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian-speaking]] peoples of Mesopotamia under the [[Akkadian Empire]], which lasted from c. 2334 BC to 2154 BC.<ref>Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', pp. 161–191.</ref>

After its fall, the greater remaining part of Assyria was a geopolitical region and [[province]] of other nations between the mid-2nd century BC and late 3rd century AD, with a patchwork of small independent Assyrian kingdoms adjacent to it. The region of Assyria fell under the successive control of the [[Medes]], the [[Achaemenid Empire]], the [[Seleucid Empire]], the [[Parthian Empire]], the [[Roman Empire]], and the [[Sasanian Empire]]. The [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] in the mid-seventh century finally dissolved it as a single entity, after which the remnants of the [[Assyrian people]] gradually became an ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious minority in the [[Assyrian homeland]], surviving there to this day as an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people of the region.<ref name="Parpola, Simo 2004">Parpola, Simo (2004).

Assyria was also sometimes known as [[Subartu]] and ''Azuhinum'' prior to the rise of the [[city-state]] of Aššūr, after which it was Aššūrāyu, and after its fall, from 605 BC through to the late seventh century AD variously as [[Achaemenid Assyria]], and also referenced as Atouria, [[Ator]], [[Hathor|Athor]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Y Odisho|first=George|title=The sound system of modern Assyrian (Neo-Aramaic)|year=1998|publisher=Harrowitz|isbn=3-447-02744-4|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ON7BEtQvejcC&lpg=PA8&dq=strabo%20atouria&pg=PA8#v=onepage&q=strabo%20atouria&f=false}}</ref> according to [[Strabo]], ''Syria'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]), ''Assyria'' ([[Latin]]) and [[Asōristān]] (Middle Persian). "Assyria" can also refer to the geographic region or heartland where Assyria, its empires and the Assyrian people were (and still are) centered. The modern [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic-speaking]] Christian ethnic minority in northern [[Iraq]], north east [[Syria]], southeast [[Turkey]] and northwest [[Iran]] are the descendants of the ancient Assyrians (see [[Assyrian continuity]]).<ref name="H.W.F. Saggs">Saggs notes that: "the destruction of the Assyrian empire did not wipe out its population. They were predominantly peasant farmers and, since Assyria contains some of the best wheat land in the Near East, their descendants would, as opportunity permitted, build new villages over the old cities and carry on with agricultural life, remembering traditions of the former cities. After seven or eight centuries and various vicissitudes, these people became Christians" (''[[The Might That Was Assyria]]'', p. 290).</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf |title=Parpola identity_article |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717071922/http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref>

==Pre-history==
In prehistoric times, the region that was to become known as Assyria (and Subartu) was home to a [[Neanderthal]] culture such as has been found at the [[Shanidar Cave]]. The earliest [[Neolithic]] sites in Assyria were the [[Jarmo]] culture c. 7100&nbsp;BC and [[Tell Hassuna]], the centre of the ''Hassuna culture'', c. 6000&nbsp;BC.

During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians throughout [[Mesopotamia]], which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].<ref name="Deutscher">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XFwUxmCdG94C|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20–21|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)}}</ref> The influence of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] (a [[language isolate]]) on Akkadian, and vice versa, is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.<ref name="Deutscher"/> This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium BC as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.<ref name="Deutscher"/> Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere after the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),<ref name="woods">Woods C. 2006 "Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian".

The cities of [[Assur]] and [[Nineveh]], together with a number of other towns and cities, existed since at least before the middle of the 3rd millennium BC (c. 2600 BC), although they appear to have been Sumerian-ruled administrative centres at this time, rather than independent states.

Greco-Roman classical writers such as [[Julius Africanus]], [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]] dated the founding of Assyria to various dates between 2284&nbsp;BC and 2057&nbsp;BC,<ref>''[[Cory's Ancient Fragments]]'', [[Isaac Preston Cory]], 1832, p.&nbsp;74.</ref><ref>''Roman History'', Book 1, Chapter 6.</ref><ref>''The History of Antiquity'' by Maximilian Duncker, 1877, p.&nbsp;26–30.</ref> listing the earliest king as [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]] or [[Ninus]].

Assyrian tradition itself lists the first king of Assyria as the 25th century BC [[Tudiya]], and an early urbanised Assyrian king named [[Ushpia]] (c. 2050 BC) as having dedicated the first temple to the god Ashur in the city in the mid-21st century BC. It is highly likely that the city was named in honour of its patron Assyrian god with the same name.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The city of [[Assur|Aššur]], together with a number of other Assyrian cities, seem to have been established by 2600 BC. However it is likely that they were initially Sumerian-dominated administrative centres. In the late 26th century BC, [[Eannatum]] of [[Lagash]], then the dominant [[Sumer]]ian ruler in Mesopotamia, mentions "smiting [[Subartu]]" (Subartu being the Sumerian name for Assyria). Similarly, in ''c.'' the early 25th century BC, [[Lugal-Anne-Mundu]] the king of the Sumerian state of [[Adab (city)|Adab]] lists Subartu as paying tribute to him.

Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is known. In the [[Assyrian King List]], the earliest king recorded was [[Tudiya]]. According to [[Georges Roux]] he would have lived in the latter half of the 25th century BC, i.e. somewhere between 2450 BC and 2400 BC. In archaeological reports from [[Ebla]], it appeared that Tudiya's activities were confirmed with the discovery of a tablet where he concluded a treaty for the operation of a ''[[Karum (trade post)|karum]]'' (trading colony) in Eblaite territory, with "king" Ibrium of Ebla (who is now known to have been the [[vizier]] of Ebla for king Ishar-Damu).

Tudiya was succeeded on the list by [[Adamu]] and then a further thirteen rulers (Yangi, Shuhlamu, Harharu, Mandaru, Imshu, Harshu, Didanu, Hanu, Zuabu, Nuabu, Abazu, Belu and Azarah). Nothing concrete is yet known about these names, although it has been noted that a much later Babylonian tablet listing the ancestral lineage of [[Hammurabi]], the [[Amorite]] king of Babylon, seems to have copied the same names from Tudiya through Nuabu, though in a heavily corrupted form.

The earliest kings, such as Tudiya, who are recorded as ''kings who lived in tents'', were independent semi-nomadic pastoralist rulers. These kings at some point became fully urbanised and founded the ''city state'' of [[Ashur]] in the mid 21st century BC.<ref>Saggs, ''The Might'', 24.</ref>

====Akkadian Empire and Neo-Sumerian Empires====

{{further information|Akkadian Empire|Neo-Sumerian Empire}}

During the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2334–2154 BC), the Assyrians, like all the Mesopotamian Semites (and also the Sumerians), became subject to the dynasty of the city state of [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], centered in central Mesopotamia. The Akkadian Empire founded by [[Sargon the Great]] claimed to encompass the surrounding "four quarters". The region of Assyria, north of the seat of the empire in central Mesopotamia, had also been known as [[Subartu]] by the Sumerians, and the name Azuhinum in Akkadian records also seems to refer to Assyria proper.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=EwBuAAAAMAAJ |page=32 }} |title=Prehistory and Protohistory of the Arabian Peninsula: Bahrain|work=M. A. Nayeem|year=1990|page=32}}</ref>

Assyrian rulers were subject to Sargon and his successors, and the city of Ashur became a regional administrative center of the Empire, implicated by the [[Nuzi#Archaeology|Nuzi tablets]].<ref name="Shendge1997">{{cite book|author=Malati J. Shendge|title=The language of the Harappans: from Akkadian to Sanskrit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xb6CZMmwo00C&pg=PA46|accessdate=22 April 2011|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-325-0|page=46}}</ref> During this period, the Akkadian-speaking Semites of Mesopotamia came to rule an empire encompassing not only Mesopotamia itself but large swathes of [[Asia Minor]], ancient Iran, Elam, the [[Arabian Peninsula]], Canaan and Syria.

Assyria seems to have already been firmly involved in trade in Asia Minor by this time; the earliest known reference to Anatolian ''[[Karum (trade post)|karums]]'' in [[Hittite empire|Hatti]] was found on later cuneiform tablets describing the early period of the Akkadian Empire (c. 2350 BC). On those tablets, Assyrian traders in [[Burushanda]] implored the help of their ruler, Sargon the Great, and this appellation continued to exist throughout the Assyrian Empire for about 1,700 years. The name "Hatti" itself even appears in later accounts of his grandson, [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], campaigning in [[Anatolia]].

Assyrian and Akkadian traders spread the use of writing in the form of the Mesopotamian [[cuneiform]] script to Asia Minor and [[The Levant]] (modern [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]). However, towards the end of the reign of [[Sargon the Great]], the Assyrian faction rebelled against him; "the tribes of Assyria of the upper country—in their turn attacked, but they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled their habitations, and he smote them grievously".<ref>Malati J. Shendge (1 January 1997). The language of the Harappans: from Akkadian to Sanskrit. Abhinav Publications. p. 46. ISBN 978-81-7017-325-0. Retrieved 22 April 2011.</ref>

The Akkadian Empire was destroyed by economic decline and internal civil war, followed by attacks from barbarian [[Gutian people]] in 2154 BC. The rulers of Assyria during the period between c. 2154 BC and 2112 BC once again became fully independent, as the Gutians are only known to have administered southern Mesopotamia. However, the king list is the only information from Assyria for this period.

Most of Assyria briefly became part of the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] (or [[3rd dynasty of Ur]]) founded in c. 2112 BC. Sumerian domination extended as far as the city of Ashur, but appears not to have reached Nineveh and the far north of Assyria. One local ruler (''shakkanakku'') named Zāriqum (who does not appear on any Assyrian king list) is listed as paying tribute to [[Amar-Sin]] of Ur. Ashur's rulers appear to have remained largely under Sumerian domination until the mid-21st century BC (c. 2050 BC); the king list names Assyrian rulers for this period and several are known from other references to have also borne the title of ''shakkanakka'' or vassal governors for the neo-Sumerians.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=fhMTRcUm9WsC |page=7 }} |title=The Invention of Cuneiform: Writing in Sumer|work=Jean-Jacques Glassner|year=1990|page=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=BPX0h_wbFtEC |page=11 }} |title=Area Handbook for the Persian Gulf States|work=Richard F.

Assyria became a regionally powerful nation in the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] from the late 21st century to the mid 18th century BC. Following this, it found itself under short periods of Babylonian and [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrian]] rule in the 18th and 15th centuries BC respectively. From the mid 18th century BC, Assyria came into conflict with the newly created city state of [[Babylon]], which eventually eclipsed the far older [[Sumero-Akkadian]] states and cities in the south.

The first written inscriptions by 'urbanised' Assyrian kings appear in the mid-21st century BC, after they had shrugged off Sumerian domination. The land of Assyria as a whole then consisted of a number of city states and small kingdoms, some of which were initially independent of Assyria. The foundation of the first major temple in the city of Ashur was traditionally ascribed to king [[Ushpia]] who reigned c. 2050 BC, possibly a contemporary of [[Ishbi-Erra]] of [[Isin]] and [[Naplanum]] of [[Larsa]]. He was reputedly succeeded by kings named [[Apiashal]], [[Sulili]], [[Kikkiya]] and [[Akiya]] (died c. 2026 BC), of whom little is known, apart from much later mentions of Kikkiya conducting fortifications on the city walls, and building work on temples in Ashur.

The Amorites had overrun the kingdoms of southern Mesopotamia and the Levant between the 21st and 19th centuries BC, but had hitherto been successfully repelled by the Assyrian kings during this period. However, [[Erishum II]] (c. 1818–1809 BC) was to be the last king of the dynasty of [[Puzur-Ashur I]], founded c. 2025 BC. In 1808 BC he was deposed and the throne of Assyria was usurped by [[Shamshi-Adad I]] (c. 1809 – 1776 BC) in the expansion of Amorite tribes from the [[Khabur River]] delta in the north eastern Levant.

After securing its borders on all sides, Assyria entered into a quiet and peaceful period in its history which lasted for two and a half centuries, remaining untroubled by the emergence of the [[Hittite Empire]] and Hurri-Mitanni Empire, both to the north of Assyria, and by the [[Kassites]] who had seized [[Babylonia]] from its Amorite founders.

Assyria found itself under short periods of Babylonian and [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrian]] rule in the 18th and 15th centuries BC respectively. The emergence of the Mitanni Empire in the 16th century BC did eventually lead to a short period of sporadic Mitannian-Hurrian domination in the latter half of the 15th century. The Indo-European-speaking Mitannians are thought to have conquered and formed the ruling class over the indigenous Hurrians of eastern Anatolia. The Hurrians spoke a [[language isolate]], i.e. neither Semitic nor Indo-European.

{{Main article|Middle Assyrian Empire}}
Beginning with the campaigns of [[Adad-nirari II]] from 911 BC, it again became a great power over the next three centuries, overthrowing the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt]] and conquering [[Egypt]], driving the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]], [[Kushites]] and [[Nubians]] from Egypt. The Middle period (1365 BC - 1056 BC) saw reigns of great kings, such as [[Ashur-uballit I]], [[Arik-den-ili]], [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] and [[Tiglath-Pileser I]]. During this period, Assyria overthrew the empire of the [[Hurri]]-[[Mitanni]] and eclipsed the [[Hittite Empire]], [[Egyptian Empire]], [[Babylonia]], [[Elam]], [[Canaan]] and [[Phrygia]] in the [[Near East]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Calculated Frightfulness of Ashur Nasir Pal|last=Olmstead|first=A.T.|year=1918|volume=38|pages=209–263|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society}}</ref>

====Society and law in the Middle Assyrian Period====

The Middle Assyrian kingdom was well organized, and in the firm control of the king, who also functioned as the High Priest of [[Anshar|Ashur]], the state god. He had certain obligations to fulfill in the cult, and had to provide resources for the temples. The priesthood became a major power in Assyrian society. Conflicts with the priesthood are thought to have been behind the murder of king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]].

The Middle Assyrian Period was marked by the long wars fought that helped build Assyria into a [[warrior society]]. The king depended on both the citizen class and priests in his capital, and the landed nobility who supplied the horses needed by Assyria's military. Documents and letters illustrate the importance of the latter to Assyrian society.

Assyria needed less artificial [[irrigation]] than Babylonia, and horse-breeding was extensive. Portions of elaborate texts about the care and training of them have been found. Trade was carried out in all directions. The mountain country to the north and west of Assyria was a major source of metal ore, as well as lumber. Economic factors were a common ''[[casus belli]]''.

All free male citizens were obliged to serve in the army for a time, a system which was called the ''ilku''-service. A [[legal code]] was produced during the 14th and 13th centuries which, among other things, clearly shows that the social position of women in Assyria was lower than that of neighbouring societies. Men were permitted to [[divorce]] their wives with no compensation paid to the latter. If a woman committed [[adultery]], she could be beaten or put to death. It's not certain if these laws were seriously enforced, but they appear to be a backlash against some older documents that granted things like equal compensation to both partners in divorce.

The women of the king's [[harem]] and their servants were also subject to harsh punishments, such as [[Strike (attack)|beatings]], [[mutilation]], and death. Assyria, in general, had much harsher laws than most of the region. [[Execution]]s were not uncommon, nor were whippings followed by [[forced labour]]. Some offenses allowed the accused a trial under torture/duress. One tablet that covers property rights has brutal penalties for violators. A creditor could force debtors to work for him, but not sell them.

Assyria was open to [[homosexual]] relationships between men.<ref name="Dynes">Homosexuality in the Ancient World, by Wayne R. Dynes, Taylor & Francis, 1992, p.

[[Omen]] texts referred to male homosexual acts without moral judgement or affirmation.<ref name="Nissinen" /> One historian notes that the laws would not be so detailed "if homosexual behavior were not a familiar aspect of daily life of early Mesopotamia."<ref>The Origins and Role of Same-Sex Relations in Human Societies, by James Neill, McFarland, 27 Oct 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&lpg=PA83&dq=assyria%20homosexuality&pg=PA83#v=onepage&q&f=false p.83]</ref>

====Assyrian expansion and empire, 1392–1056 BC====
[[File:Assyrian troops return.png|thumb|Assyrian troops return after victory.]]

Assyria had difficulties with keeping the trade routes open. Unlike the situation in the Old Assyrian period, the Anatolian metal trade now was effectively dominated by the empires of the [[Hittites]] and the [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrians]]. These people now controlled the Mediterranean ports, while the [[Kassites]] controlled the river route south to the [[Persian Gulf]]. The main Assyrian cities of the middle period were [[Assur|Ashur]], [[Kalhu]] ([[Nimrud]]) and [[Nineveh]], all situated in the [[Tigris]] River valley, together with [[Arrapha]] (modern [[Kirkuk]]), [[Gasur]], [[Ekallatum]] and Arbela (modern [[Irbil]]).

The Aramaeans of northern and central Syria were the next targets of the Assyrian king, who made his way as far as the sources of the Tigris.{{sfnp|''EB'', "Tiglath-Pileser"|1911}} The control of the high road to the Mediterranean was secured by the possession of the Hittite town of [[Pitru]]<ref>Bryce, Trevor.

[[File:Flaying of rebels.jpg|thumb|Assyrians skinning or [[flaying]] their prisoners alive]]
Late in his reign, the Middle Assyrian Empire erupted into civil war, when a rebellion was orchestrated by Tukulti-Mer, a pretender to the throne of Assyria. [[Ashur-bel-kala]] eventually crushed Tukulti-Mer and his allies, however the civil war in Assyria had allowed hordes of Arameans to take advantage of the situation, and press in on Assyrian controlled territory from the west. Ashur-bel-kala counterattacked them, and conquered as far as [[Carchemish]] and the source of the [[Khabur river]], but by the end of his reign many of the areas of Syria and Phoenicia-Canaan to the west of these regions as far as the Mediterranean, previously under firm Assyrian control, were eventually lost to the Assyrian Empire.

====Assyria during the Bronze Age Collapse, 1055–936 BC====

The [[Bronze Age Collapse]] from 1200 BC to 900 BC was a [[Dark Ages (historiography)|dark age]] for the entire [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Caucasus]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkan]] regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people.

Assyria and its empire were not unduly affected by these tumultuous events for some 150 years, perhaps the only ancient power that was not. However, upon the death of [[Ashur-bel-kala]] in 1056 BC, Assyria went into a ''comparative'' decline for the next 100 or so years. The empire shrank significantly, and by 1020 BC Assyria appears to have controlled only areas close to Assyria itself, essential to keeping trade routes open in eastern Aramea, south eastern Asia Minor, central Mesopotamia and north western Iran.

New [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic-speaking]] peoples such as the Arameans, [[Chaldea]]ns and [[Suteans]] moved into areas to the west and south of Assyria, including overrunning much of Babylonia to the south, Indo-European speaking [[Iranic]] peoples such as the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Parthians]] moved into the lands to the east of Assyria, displacing the native Gutians and pressuring Elam and [[Mannea]] (which were all ancient non Indo-European civilisations of Iran), and to the north the Phrygians overran the Hittites, a new Hurrian state named [[Urartu]] arose in the Caucasus, and Cimmerians, [[Colchians]] (Georgians) and Scythians around the Black Sea and Caucasus. Egypt was divided and in disarray, and Israelites were battling with other [[West Asia]]n peoples such as the [[Amalekites]], [[Moabites]], [[Edomites]] and [[Ammonites]] and the non-Semitic-speaking [[Peleset]]/[[Philistines]] (who have been conjectured to be one of the so-called [[Sea Peoples]])<ref name="AK2013">{{citation|last=Killebrew|first=Ann E.|title=The Philistines and Other "Sea Peoples" in Text and Archaeology|date=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBCl2IQfNioC&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false|work=Society of Biblical Literature Archaeology and biblical studies|volume=15|page=2|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|isbn=978-1-58983-721-8}}. Quote: "First coined in 1881 by the French Egyptologist G. Maspero (1896), the somewhat misleading term "Sea Peoples" encompasses the ethnonyms Lukka, Sherden, Shekelesh, Teresh, Eqwesh, Denyen, Sikil / Tjekker, Weshesh, and Peleset (Philistines). [Footnote: The modern term "Sea Peoples" refers to peoples that appear in several New Kingdom Egyptian texts as originating from "islands" (tables 1–2; Adams and Cohen, this volume; see, e.g., [[Robert Drews|Drews]] 1993, 57 for a summary). The use of quotation marks in association with the term "Sea Peoples" in our title is intended to draw attention to the problematic nature of this commonly used term. It is noteworthy that the designation "of the sea" appears only in relation to the Sherden, Shekelesh, and Eqwesh. Subsequently, this term was applied somewhat indiscriminately to several additional ethnonyms, including the Philistines, who are portrayed in their earliest appearance as invaders from the north during the reigns of Merenptah and Ramesses Ill (see, e.g., Sandars 1978; Redford 1992, 243, n. 14; for a recent review of the primary and secondary literature, see Woudhuizen 2006). Hencefore the term Sea Peoples will appear without quotation marks.]"</ref><ref name="Drews48">[https://books.google.com/books?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48 The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe Ca. 1200 B.C., Robert Drews, p48–61] Quote: "The thesis that a great "migration of the Sea Peoples" occurred ca. 1200 B.C. is supposedly based on Egyptian inscriptions, one from the reign of Merneptah and another from the reign of Ramesses III. Yet in the inscriptions themselves such a migration nowhere appears. After reviewing what the Egyptian texts have to say about 'the sea peoples', one Egyptologist (Wolfgang Helck) recently remarked that although some things are unclear, "eins ist aber sicher: Nach den agyptischen Texten haben wir es nicht mit einer 'Volkerwanderung' zu tun." Thus the migration hypothesis is based not on the inscriptions themselves but on their interpretation."</ref> for the control of southern Canaan.

Despite the apparent weakness of Assyria in comparison to its former might, at heart it in fact remained a solid, well defended nation whose warriors were the best in the world. Assyria, with its stable monarchy, powerful army and secure borders was in a stronger position during this time than potential rivals such as Egypt, Babylonia, Elam, Phrygia, Urartu, Persia and Media. Kings such as [[Ashur-bel-kala]], [[Eriba-Adad II]], [[Ashur-rabi II]], [[Ashurnasirpal I]], [[Tiglath-Pileser II]] and [[Ashur-Dan II]] successfully defended Assyria's borders and upheld stability during this tumultuous time.

Assyrian kings during this period appear to have adopted a policy of maintaining and defending a compact, secure nation and satellite colonies immediately surrounding it, and interspersed this with sporadic punitive raids and invasions of neighbouring territories when the need arose.

The Neo-Assyrian Empire is usually considered to have begun with the accession of [[Adad-nirari II]], in 911 BC, lasting until the fall of Nineveh at the hands of the [[Babylonians|Babylonians, Chaldeans]], [[Medes|Medes/Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] in 612 BC.<ref>[http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=ae_chart Chart of World Kingdoms, Nations and Empires—All Empires] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121003532/http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=ae_chart|date=21 January 2012}}</ref>

====Expansion, 911–627 BC====
Tiring of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian interference in the Assyrian Empire, [[Esarhaddon]] decided to conquer Egypt. In 671 BC he crossed the [[Sinai Desert]], invaded and took Egypt with surprising ease and speed. He drove its foreign [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] and [[Ethiopia]]n rulers out, destroying the [[Kushite Empire]] in the process. Esarhaddon declared himself "king of [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], and [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]". Esarhaddon stationed a small army in northern Egypt and describes how; "All Ethiopians (read Nubians/Kushites) I deported from Egypt, leaving not one left to do homage to me". He installed native Egyptian princes throughout the land to rule on his behalf.

Under [[Ashurbanipal]] (669–627 BC), Assyrian domination spanned from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (modern [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]) in the north to [[Nubia]], [[Egypt]], [[Libya]] and [[Arabia]] in the south, and from the [[East Mediterranean]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Antioch]] in the west to [[Persia]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] in the east.

[[File:Susa-destruction.jpg|thumb|Ashurbanipal's brutal campaign against [[Elam]] in 647 BC is recorded in this relief.]]

Ultimately, Assyria conquered [[Babylonia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Elam]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Urartu]] ([[Armenia]]), [[Phoenicia]], [[Aramea]]/[[Syria]], [[Phrygia]], the [[Neo-Hittites|Neo-Hittite States]], the [[Hurrian|Hurrian lands]], [[Arabia]], [[Gutium]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samarra]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]], [[Corduene]], [[Cilicia]], [[Mannea]], and [[Cyprus]], and defeated and/or exacted tribute from [[Scythia]], [[Crimean Peninsula|Cimmeria]], [[Lydia]], [[Nubia]], [[Ethiopia]] and others. At its height, the Empire encompassed the whole of the modern nations of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Palestine (Samaria)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Cyprus]], together with large swathes of [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Turkey]], [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]].

Assyria now appeared stronger than ever. However, the long struggles pacifying the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Arameans and Elamites, the exertions undertaken in keeping the Medes, Scythians, Persians, Urartians and Cimmerians subjugated, and the constant campaigning over three centuries to control and expand its vast empire in all directions, had left Assyria materially, economically and physically exhausted. It had been drained of wealth and manpower; the devastated provinces could yield nothing to supply the needs of the imperial exchequer, it was difficult to find sufficient troops to garrison and effectively control the huge empire, and after the death of Ashurbanipal severe civil unrest broke out in Assyria itself, and the empire began to unravel.<sup>[''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>

====Downfall, 626–605 BC====
The Assyrian Empire was severely crippled following the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC—the nation and its empire descending into a prolonged and brutal series of civil wars involving three rival kings, [[Ashur-etil-ilani]], [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] and [[Sin-shar-ishkun]]. [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Egypt's 26th Dynasty]], which had been installed by the Assyrians as vassals, quietly detached itself from Assyria, although it was careful to retain friendly relations.

The [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] took advantage of the bitter fighting among the Assyrians to raid Assyrian colonies, with hordes of horse borne marauders ravaging parts of [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], where the vassal kings of [[Urartu]] and [[Lydia]] begged their Assyrian overlord for help in vain. They also raided the [[Levant]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (where [[Ashkelon]] was sacked by the Scythians) and all the way into Egypt whose coasts were ravaged and looted with impunity.

The [[Iranic]] peoples (the [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns and [[Parthians]]), aided by the previous Assyrian destruction of the hitherto dominant [[Elamites]] of [[Ancient Iran]], also took advantage of the upheavals in Assyria to coalesce into a powerful Median dominated force which destroyed the ''pre-Iranic'' Assyrian vassal kingdom of [[Mannea]] and absorbed the remnants of the pre-Iranic [[Elamites]] of southern Iran, and the equally pre-Iranic [[Gutians]], [[Manneans]] and [[Kassites]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea]].

[[Cyaxares]] (technically a vassal of Assyria), in an alliance with the Scythians and Cimmerians, launched a surprise attack on a civil war beleaguered Assyria in 615 BC, sacking Kalhu (the Biblical Calah/Nimrud) and taking Arrapkha (modern Kirkuk) and [[Gasur]]. Nabopolassar, still pinned down in southern Mesopotamia by Assyrian forces, was completely uninvolved in this major breakthrough against Assyria.

Despite the sorely depleted state of Assyria, bitter fighting ensued; throughout 614 BC the alliance of powers continued to gradually make hard fought inroads into Assyria itself, however in 613 BC the Assyrians somehow rallied against the odds and scored a number of counterattacking victories over the Medes-Persians, Babylonians-Chaldeans and Scythians-Cimmerians. This led to the coalition of forces ranged against it to unite and launch a massive combined attack in 612 BC, finally besieging and entering Nineveh in late 612 BC, with Sin-shar-ishkun being slain in the bitter street by street fighting. Despite the loss of almost all of its major cities, and in the face of overwhelming odds, Assyrian resistance continued under [[Ashur-uballit II]] (612-605 BC), who fought his way out of Nineveh and coalesced Assyrian forces around [[Harran]] (in modern south east Turkey), [[Carchemish]] (modern [[Jarablus]] in north east Syria) and in the vassal kingdom of [[Urartu]] (in modern north eastern Turkey).<ref>K.B. Matveev, Al-Ashuriyyun wal Mas'ala Al-Ashuriyya - ''As for what was remaining of the Assyrian army, they were led by the brother of the King Ashurbanipal from the city of Ashur towards Haran, located Northwest of the city of Nineveh. From there they pushed further North in the district of Eysala for the purpose of being hidden from the eyes from neighbouring Urartu. The Medeans however eventually took control of the latter and actually reached their very capital, Ushpi. Part of this Assyrian army remained in the mountains of Eysala,along with the peaceful populations from home who followed them there. The other portion of the army crossed the Euphrates and took refuge in the castle of Charchemish (currently Jarablus) where most of the Assyrian army was finally destroyed in 605BC.''</ref> However, the alliance of powers took Harran in 608 BC, and after a failed bid to recapture the city by the Assyrian king the same year, Carchemish too fell in 605 BC.

Sections of the Assyrian army retreated to the western corner of Assyria after the fall of Harran and Carchemish, and a number of Assyrian imperial records survive between 604 BC and 599 BC in and around the Assyrian city of [[Dur-Katlimmu]] in what is today north eastern Syria, and so it is possible that remnants of the Assyrian administration and army still continued to hold out in the region for a few years.<ref>Assyria 1995: Proceedings of the 10th Anniversary Symposium of the Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project / Helsinki, September 7–11, 1995.</ref> Certainly by 599 BC at the very latest, Assyria had been destroyed as an independent political entity, although it was to launch major rebellions against the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 546 BC and 520 BC, and remained a [[geo-political]] region, ethnic entity and colonised province until the late 7th century AD, with small Assyrian states emerging in the region between the 2nd century BC and 4th century AD.

===Assyria after the empire===

====Achaemenid Assyria, Osroene, Adiabene, Asōristān, Athura and Hatra====
{{Main article|Osroene|Adiabene|Asōristān}}

Assyria was initially ruled by the short lived [[Median Empire]] (605–549 BC) after its fall. In a twist of fate, [[Nabonidus]] the last king of Babylon (together with his son and co-regent [[Belshazzar]]) was himself an Assyrian from [[Harran]]. He had overthrown the short lived [[Chaldea]]n dynasty in Babylonia, after which the Chaldeans disappeared from history, being fully absorbed into the native population of Babylonia. However, apart from plans to dedicate religious temples in the city of Harran, Nabonidus showed little interest in rebuilding Assyria. [[Nineveh]] and [[Kalhu]] remained in ruins with only small numbers of Assyrians living within them, conversely a number of towns and cities such as [[Arrapkha]], [[Guzana]], [[Nohadra]] and [[Harran]] remained intact, and [[Assur]] and [[Arbil|Arbela]] ([[Irbil]]) were not completely destroyed, as is attested by their later revival. However, Assyria spent much of this short period in a degree of devastation following its fall.

====Achaemenid Assyria (549–330 BC)====

{{Main article|Achaemenid Assyria}}

After the Medes were overthrown by the [[Persian people|Persians]] as the dominant force in Ancient Iran, Assyria was ruled by the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]] (as [[Athura]]) from 549 BC to 330 BC (see [[Achaemenid Assyria]]). Between 546 and 545 BC, Assyria rebelled against the new Persian Dynasty, which had usurped the previous Median dynasty. The rebellion centered around [[Tyareh]] was eventually quashed by [[Cyrus the Great]].

Assyria seems to have recovered dramatically, and flourished during this period. It became a major agricultural and administrative centre of the Achaemenid Empire, and its soldiers were a mainstay of the Persian Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html |title=Assyrians after Assyria |publisher=Nineveh.com |date=4 September 1999 |accessdate=19 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714183623/http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html |archivedate=14 July 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref> In fact, Assyria even became powerful enough to raise another full-scale revolt against the Persian empire in 520–519 BC.

The Persians had spent centuries under Assyrian domination (their first ruler [[Achaemenes]] and his successors, having been vassals of Assyria), and Assyrian influence can be seen in Achaemenid art, infrastructure and administration. Early Persian rulers saw themselves as successors to [[Ashurbanipal]], and [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] was retained as the ''lingua franca'' of the empire for over two hundred years, and Greek writers such as [[Thucydides]] still referred to it as ''the Assyrian language''.<ref>Van de Mieroop, ''History'', p. 293.</ref> [[Nineveh]] was never rebuilt however, and 200 years after it was sacked [[Xenophon]] reported only small numbers of Assyrians living amongst its ruins. Conversely the ancient city of [[Assur]] once more became a rich and prosperous entity.<ref>Curtis, John (November 2003). "The Achaemenid Period in Northern Iraq". L'archéologie de l'empire achéménide (Paris, France): 12.</ref>

It was in 5th century BC Assyria that the [[Syriac language]] and [[Syriac script]] evolved. Five centuries later these were later to have a global influence as the liturgical language and written script for [[Syriac Christianity]] and its accompanying [[Syriac literature]] which also emerged in Assyria before spreading throughout the Near East, Asia Minor, The Caucasus, Central Asia, the Indian Subcontinent and China.

====Macedonian and Seleucid Assyria====
In 332 BC, Assyria fell to [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] Emperor from [[Greece]], who called the inhabitants ''Assyrioi''. The [[Macedonian Empire]] (332–312) was partitioned in 312 BC. It thereafter became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] (312 BC). It is from this period that the later [[Name of Syria|''Syria'' Vs ''Assyria'' naming controversy arises]], the Seleucids applied the name not only to Assyria itself, but also to the Levantine lands to the west (historically known as [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] and [[Eber Nari]]), which had been part of the Assyrian empire but, the north east corner aside, never a part of Assyria proper.

When the Seleucids lost control of Assyria proper, the name ''Syria'' survived but was erroneously applied only to the land of [[Aramea]] (also known as [[Eber Nari]]) to the west that had once been part of the Assyrian empire, but apart from the north eastern corner, had never been a part of Assyria itself, nor inhabited by Assyrians. This was to lead to both the Assyrians from Northern Mesopotamia and the Arameans and Phoenicians from the Levant being collectively dubbed ''Syrians'' (and later also ''Syriacs'') in [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] and later European culture, regardless of ethnicity, history or geography.

During Seleucid rule, Assyrians ceased to hold the senior military, economic and civil positions they had enjoyed under the Achaemenids, being largely replaced by Greeks. The Greek language also replaced Mesopotamian East Aramaic as the lingua franca of the empire, although this did not affect the Assyrian population themselves, who were not Hellenised during the Seleucid era.

During the Seleucid period in southern Mesopotamia, [[Babylon]] was gradually abandoned in favour of a new city named [[Seleucia on the Tigris]], effectively bringing an end to ''Babylonia'' as a geo-political entity.

====Parthian Assyria (150 BC – 225 AD)====
By 150 BC, Assyria was largely under the control of the [[Parthian Empire]]. The Parthians seem to have exercised only loose control over Assyria, and between the mid 2nd century BC and 4th century AD a number of [[Neo-Assyrian]] states arose; these included the ancient capital of [[Assur]] itself, [[Adiabene]] with its capital of [[Irbid|Arbela]] (modern [[Irbil]]), [[Beth Nuhadra]] with its capital of [[Nohadra]] (modern [[Dohuk]]), [[Osroene]], with its capitals of [[Edessa]] and [[Amid]] (modern [[Sanliurfa]] and [[Diyarbakir]]), [[Hatra]], and "ܒܝܬܓܪܡܝ" ([[Beth Garmai]]) with its capital at [[Arrapha]] (modern [[Kirkuk]]).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VfYnu5F20coC&pg=PA135|title=Sasanid soldiers in early Muslim society: the origins of 'Ayyārān and Futuwwa|last=Mohsen|first=Zakeri|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|year=1995|isbn=978-3-447-03652-8|pages=135}}</ref>

These freedoms were accompanied by a major Assyrian cultural revival, and temples to the Assyrian national gods [[Ashur]], [[Sin]], [[Hadad]], [[Ishtar]], [[Ninurta]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] and [[Shamash]] were once more dedicated throughout Assyria and Upper Mesopotamia during this period.<ref>Crone & Cook 1977, p. 55</ref>

In addition, [[Christianity]] arrived in Assyria soon after the death of Christ and the Assyrians began to gradually convert to [[Christianity]] from the [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]] during the period between the early first and third centuries. Assyria became an important centre of [[Syriac Christianity]] and [[Syriac Literature]], with the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] evolving in Assyria, and the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] partly also, indeed Osroene became the first independent [[Christian]] state in history.<ref name="Winkler p. 1"/>

====Roman Assyria (116–8)====
{{Main article|Assyria (Roman province)}}
However, in 116, under [[Trajan]], Assyria and its independent states were briefly taken over by Rome as the [[Assyria (Roman province)|province of Assyria]]. The Assyrian kingdom of [[Adiabene]] was destroyed as an independent state during this period. Roman rule lasted only a few years, and the Parthians once more regained control with the help of the Assyrians, who were incited to overthrow the Roman garrisons by the Parthian king. However, a number of Assyrians were conscripted into the [[Roman Army]], with many serving in the region of [[Hadrians Wall]] in [[Roman Britain]], and inscriptions in Aramaic made by soldiers have been discovered in [[Northern England]] dating from the second century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/oct/13/hadrians-wall|title=When Syrians, Algerians and Iraqis patrolled Hadrian's Wall|author=Charlotte Higgins|work=the Guardian|accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>

With loose Parthian rule restored, Assyria and its patchwork of states continued much as they had before the Roman interregnum, although Assyria and Mesopotamia as a whole became a front line between the Roman and Parthian empires. Other new religious movements also emerged in the form of [[gnosticism|gnostic sects]] such as [[Mandeanism]], as well as the now extinct [[Manichean]] religion.

===Christian period===

====Sassanid Assyria (226–c.650)====
{{Main article|Asōristān}}
In 226, Assyria was largely taken over by the [[Sasanian Empire]]. After driving out the Romans and Parthians, the Sassanid rulers set about [[annexing]] the independent states within Assyria during the mid to late 3rd century. After the Roman empire conquered the region of Assyria in the 200s Christianity spread, and many of the ethnically Assyrian churches that exist today are among the oldest in the world. For example, the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] is purported to have been founded by [[St Peter]] himself in 67 AD.

Nevertheless, although predominantly Christian, a minority of Assyrians still held onto their ancient [[Mesopotamian religion]] until as late as the 10th or 11th century AD.<ref name="nineveh.com">{{cite web|last=Parpola |first=Simo |title=ASSYRIAN IDENTITY IN ANCIENT TIMES AND TODAY |url=http://www.nineveh.com/parpola_eng.pdf}}</ref><ref>Fuller, 1864, pp. 200–201.</ref> The Assyrians lived in a province known as [[Asuristan]], and the region was on the frontier of the Byzantine and Sassanian empires.

The land was known as [[Asōristān]] (the Sassanid Persian name meaning "Land of the Assyrians") during this period, and became the birthplace of the distinct [[Church of the East]] (now split into the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Ancient Church of the East]] and [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]) and a centre of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], with a flourishing [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]] ([[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]) Christian culture which exists there to this day. Temples were still being dedicated to the national god [[Ashur]] (as well as other Mesopotamian gods) in his home city, in [[Harran]] and elsewhere during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, indicating the ancient pre-Christian Assyrian identity was still extant to some degree.

During the Sasanian period, much of what had once been [[Babylonia]] in southern Mesopotamia was incorporated into Assyria, and in effect the whole of Mesopotamia came to be known as Asōristān. Parts of Assyria appear to have been semi independent as late as the latter part of the 4th century AD, with a king named [[Sennacherib II]] reputedly ruling the northern reaches in 370s AD.

====Medieval Islam (600–780)====
Centuries of constant warfare between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Sassanid Empire]] left both empires exhausted, depleted, and battle-fatigued, which meant that when the [[Muslim]] [[Arab people|Arabs]] came to invade the region during the 600s from the [[Arabian peninsula]]- The empires could do little to resist it. Therefore, after the early Islamic conquests in the seventh century, Assyria was dissolved as a political entity, although the native population still regarded the region as Assyria. Under Arab rule, Mesopotamia as a whole underwent a gradual process of [[Arabisation]] and [[Islamification]], and the region saw a large influx of ''non indigenous'' Arabs, [[Kurds]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], and [[Turkic peoples]].

However, the indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] population of northern Mesopotamia resisted this process, retaining their language, religion, culture and identity.

Under the Arab Islamic empires, the Christian Assyrians were classed as ''[[dhimmis]]'', second-class citizens that had certain restrictions imposed upon them. ''Dhimmis'' were excluded from specific duties and occupations reserved for Muslims, did not enjoy the same political rights as Muslims, their word was not equal to that of a Muslim in legal and civil matters without a Muslim witness, they were subject to payment of a special tax ([[jizyah]]) and they were banned from spreading their religion further in Muslim ruled lands. However, personal matters such as marriage and divorce were governed by the cultural laws of the Assyrians.<ref>H. Patrick Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World''. Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 219.</ref><ref>Clinton Bennett (2005). Muslims and Modernity: An Introduction to the Issues and Debates. Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 163. ISBN 0-8264-5481-X. Retrieved 2012-07-07</ref>

For those reasons, and even during the Sassanian period before Islamic rule, The [[Church of the East]] formed a church structure that spread [[East Syrian Rite|Nestorian Christianity]] to as far away as China, in order to proselytize away from Muslim ruled regions In Iran and their homeland in Mesopotamia, with evidence of their massive church structure being the [[Nestorian Stele]], an artifact found in China which documented over 100 years of Christian history in China from 600-781 AD.<ref>Hill, Henry, ed (1988). Light from the East: A Symposium on the Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian Churches. Toronto, Canada. pp. 108–109</ref> Assyrian Christians maintained relations with fellow Christians in [[Armenia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. In the 12th century AD, Assyrian priests interceded on behalf of persecuted Arab Muslims in Georgia.<ref>Ecclesiastical History of Bar Hebraeus (ii 354)</ref> The Assyrian Church structure thrived during the period of 600-1300, and is regarded as a golden age for Assyrians.

====Mongol Empire (1200–1300)====
The first signs of trouble for the Assyrians started in the 13th century, when the Mongols first [[Mongol Empire#Middle East|invaded]] the Near East after the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad in 1258]] to [[Hulagu Khan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Woods|1977|pp=49–50}}</ref> Assyrians at first did very well under Mongol rule, as the [[Shamanist]] Mongols were sympathetic to them, with Assyrian priests having traveled to Mongolia centuries before. The Mongols in fact spent most of their time oppressing Muslims and Jews, outlawing the practice of circumcision and [[Halal#Dhabihah: method of slaughter|halal butchery]], as they found them repulsive and violent.<ref>Johan Elverskog (2010). [[Buddhism]] and Islam on the Silk Road (illustrated ed.). University of Pennsylvania Press. p. 228. ISBN 0-8122-4237-8. Retrieved 2010-06-28.</ref> Therefore, as one of the only groups in the region looked at in a good light, Assyrians were given special privileges and powers, with Hülegü even appointing an [[Assyrian Christian]] governor to [[Erbil]] ([[Erbil|Arbela]]), and allowing the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] to build a church there.<ref name="novacek261">{{harvnb|Nováček|Chabr|Filipský|Janiček|2008|p=261}}</ref>
[[File:Syriac Christianity.svg|thumb|Aramaic language and [[Syriac Christianity]] in the Middle East and Central Asia until being largely annihilated by [[Tamerlane]] in the 14th century]]

However, the Mongol rulers in the Near East eventually converted to [[Islam]]. Sustained persecutions of Christians throughout the entirety of the [[Ilkhanate]] began in earnest in 1295 under the rule of [[Oïrat]] amir [[Nawrūz (Mongol emir)|Nauruz]], which affected the indigenous Assyrian Christians greatly.<ref>Grousset, p. 379</ref> During the reign of the Ilkhan [[Öljeitü]], the Assyrian Christian inhabitants of Erbil seized control of the citadel and much of the city in rebellion against the Muslims. In spring 1310, the Mongol [[Malik]] (governor) of the region attempted to seize it from them with the help of the [[Kurds]] and Arabs, but was defeated. After his defeat he decided to siege the city. The Assyrians held out for three months, but the citadel was at last taken by Ilkhanate troops and Arab, Turkic and Kurdish tribesmen on July 1, 1310. The defenders of the citadel fought to the last man, and many of the Assyrian inhabitants of the lower town were subsequently massacred.<ref name=sourdel>{{harvnb|Sourdel|2010}}</ref><ref>Grousset, p. 383</ref>

Regardless of these hardships, the Assyrian people remained numerically dominant in the north of Mesopotamia as late as the 14th century AD, and the city of [[Assur]] functioned as their religious and cultural capital. However, in the mid-14th century the [[Muslim]] Turk ruler [[Tamurlane]] conducted a religiously motivated massacre of the indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]], and worked tirelessly to destroy the vast Assyrian Church structure established throughout the [[Far East]], destroying the entire structure of the church with the exception of the [[St Thomas Christians]] of the [[Malabar Coast]] in [[India]], whom number 10 million or so in modern times.<ref>http://www.cds.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wp322.pdf</ref> After Timurs campaign, The Assyrian Cultural and religious capital of [[Assur]] was completely destroyed, thousands of Assyrians were massacred, the vast church structure of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] was decimated, and the Assyrian population was from that point on reduced to a small minority living within Muslim dominated lands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assur.de/Themen/Stadtgeschichte_Engl/body_stadtgeschichte_engl.html |title=History of Ashur |publisher=Assur.de |date= |accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref>

====Breakup of the Assyrian Church (1500–1780)====
Around 100 years after the massacres by Timur, a religious schism known as the [[Schism of 1552]] occurred among the Assyrians of northern Mesopotamia, when a large number of Nestorian (followers of the Assyrian Church of the East) Assyrians in [[Diyarbakir|Amid]] elected a rival [[Patriarch]] named [[Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa]] after becoming dissatisfied with the leadership of the Assyrian Church, at this point based in [[Alqosh]]. Due to a need for an ordination by a metropolitan bishop, Sulaqa went into communion with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] after at first failing to gain acceptance within the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]. Rome named this new church ''[[Church of Assyria and Mosul|The Church of Assyria and Mosul]]'' and its first leader ''Patriarch of the East Assyrians'' in 1553 AD.

Soon after coming back Sulaqa was assassinated by supporters of the rival patriarch in Alqosh, but was able to form a new church structure and line of succession known as the Shimun Line prior to his death. This group of Assyrians eventually broke off ties with Rome, moved en masse to the [[Hakkari]] Mountains, and returned to the Nestorian faith they once adhered to prior to the Schism of 1552, while still operating independently from the original Assyrian Church structure based in Alqosh.

A decade or so before the Shimun line broke off ties with Rome, another faction within the Assyrian Church entered into communion with Rome known as the Josephite line, and upon the Shimun line leaving, inherited the now vacant Church of Assyria and Mosul, which was renamed the "[[Chaldean Catholic Church]]" in 1683. This is now believed to be due to an error by the Catholic Church, but now due to that error their followers became known as [[Chaldean Catholics]] or [[Chaldo-Assyrians]] despite having no ethnic, historical, linguistic, cultural or geographic connections whatsoever to the by now long extinct Chaldean tribe of south east Mesopotamia.<ref name="ReferenceA">Biblical Archaeology Review May/June 2001: Where Was Abraham's Ur? by Allan R. Millard</ref>

Later on in the 1830s the original [[Assyrian Church of the East]] structure in Alqosh combined with the Chaldean Catholic one, creating the modern Chaldean Catholic Church structure, which is ironic considering that the only remaining ethnic Assyrian Church to practice the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] denomination was the first one to split from the Assyrian Church of the East back in 1552. There was also another Nestorian Denomination known as the [[Ancient Church of the East]], which split from the Assyrian Church of the East due to reforms passed under the rule of [[Shimun XXIII Eshai]] in the 1960s, but with the election of [[Gewargis III]] in 2015 the churches had a reconciliation, and reunited.

In addition to the Eastern Rite Churches, The [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] also has a large number of ethnically Assyrian Adherents, who are known as ''Syriacs''. The Syriac Orthodox Church has 5 million adherents across the globe, mostly in India, but is based in Damascus. However, since the 11th century it was based in the [[Saffron Monastery]] of [[Tur Abdin]], and prior to that it was based in [[Antakya|Antioch]]. Like the Nestorian churches, schisms also occurred within the Syriac Orthodox Church. In 1626 [[Jesuit]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionaries began to proselytize among the Syriac Orthodox faithful at [[Aleppo]], forming a larger pro-catholic movement within the Syriac Orthodox Church. So in 1662, when the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate had fallen vacant, the Catholic party was able to elect one of its own, [[Ignatius Andrew Akijan|Andrew Akijan]] as Patriarch of the Syriac Church. This provoked a split in the community, and after Akijan’s death in 1677 two opposing patriarchs were elected, with one of those becoming the first Patriarch of the [[Syriac Catholic Church]]. This line of succession died out quickly, however, but in 1782 with the election of [[Ignatius Michael III Jarweh|Michael Jarweh]] as Patriarch the ''Ignatius'' line has been the head of the Syriac Catholic Church since then, and also has its base in [[Damascus]].

===Modern history===

====Ottoman Empire (1900–1928)====
[[File:Burning of Assyrians.jpg|thumb|The burning of bodies of Christian Assyrian women during the Assyrian Genocide]]
After these splits, the Assyrians suffered a number of religiously and ethnically motivated massacres throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries,<ref>Aboona, H (2008). Assyrians and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. Cambria Press. pp. 218–219.

The Assyrians suffered a further catastrophic series of events during [[World War I]] in the form of the religiously and ethnically motivated [[Assyrian Genocide]] at the hands of the [[Ottomans]] and their [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] and Arab allies from 1915 to 1918.<ref>Akçam, Taner (2012).

The Assyrian Genocide ran largely in conjunction to the similarly motivated [[Armenian Genocide]] and [[Greek Genocide]].

In reaction against Ottoman cruelty, the Assyrians took up arms, and an [[Assyrian war of independence]] was fought during [[World War I]] which took place in what is today south eastern Turkey, northern Iraq, north western Iran and north eastern Syria. For a time, the Assyrians fought successfully against overwhelming numbers, scoring a number of victories against the Ottomans and Kurds, and also hostile Arab and Iranian groups. However, due to the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]]—due to the [[Russian Revolution]]—and the similar collapse of the [[Occupation of Turkish Armenia|Armenian Defense]], the Assyrians were left without allies. As a result, The Assyrians were vastly outnumbered, outgunned, surrounded, and without supplies. The only option they had was to flee the region into northwest Iran and fight their way, with around 50,000 civilians in tow, to [[United Kingdom|British]] train lines going to [[Mandatory Iraq]]. The sizable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced to no more than 15,000 by the end of World War I, and by 1924 many of those who remained were expelled, with many leaving and later founding villages in the [[Sapna valley|Sapna]] and [[Nahla valley]]s in the [[Dohuk Governorate]] of [[Iraq]].

In 1920 the Assyrian settlements in [[Mindan]] and [[Baquba]] were attacked by [[Iraqi Arabs]], but the Assyrian tribesmen displayed their military prowess by successfully defeating and driving off the Arab forces.<ref name="ReferenceB">The Tragedy of the Assyrians By R. S. Stafford - Page - 59</ref> The Assyrians also sided with the British during the [[Iraqi revolt against the British]].

The [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1922, with ancient Assyrian military rankings, such as [[Rab-shakeh]], Rab-talia and Turtanu, being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline, and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs, Kurds and [[Iraqi Turkman|Turcoman]], guard the borders with Iran and Turkey, and protect British military installations. During the 1920s Assyrian levies saw action in effectively defeating Arab and Kurdish forces during anti-British rebellions in Iraq.<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>[[Len Deighton]] (1993), ''[[Blood, Tears and Folly]]''</ref><ref>A Modern History of the Kurds - Page 178 by David MacDowall - 2004</ref>

====Simele Massacre and World War II (1930–1950)====
[[File:Assyria Map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Assyrian populated areas]]
After Iraq was granted independence by the British in 1933, the Assyrians suffered the [[Simele Massacre]], where thousands of unarmed villagers (men, women and children) were slaughtered by joint Arab-Kurdish forces of the Iraqi Army. The massacres of civilians followed a clash between armed Assyrian tribesmen and the Iraqi army, where the Iraqi forces suffered a defeat after trying to disarm the Assyrians, whom they feared would attempt to secede from Iraq. Armed [[Iraq Levies|Assyrian Levies]] were prevented by the British from going to the aid of these civilians, and the British government then whitewashed the massacres at the [[League of Nations]].

Despite these betrayals, the Assyrians were allied with the British during [[World War II]], with eleven Assyrian companies seeing action in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]/[[Israel]] and another four serving in [[Cyprus]]. Assyrians played a major role in the victory over Arab-Iraqi forces at the [[Battle of Habbaniya]] and elsewhere in 1941, when the Iraqi government decided to join World War II on the side of [[Nazi Germany]]. The British presence in Iraq lasted until 1955, and Assyrian Levies remained attached to British forces until this time, after which they were disarmed and disbanded.

A further persecution of Assyrians took place in the [[Soviet Union]] in the late 1940s and early 1950s when thousands of Assyrians settled in Georgia, Armenia and southern Russia were forcibly deported from their homes in the dead of night by [[Stalin]] without warning or reason to [[Central Asia]], with most being relocated to [[Kazakhstan]], where a small minority still remain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://astanatimes.com/2014/12/assyrian-community-kazakhstan-survived-dark-times-now-focuses-education/|title=Assyrian Community in Kazakhstan Survived Dark Times, Now Focuses on Education|work=The Astana Times|accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>

====Ba'athism (1966–2003)====
[[File:FlagofAssyria.svg|thumb| The [[Assyrian flag|Flag of the Assyrian Nation]] (created and used since 1968)<ref>[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/assyria.html Assyria<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012000000/http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/assyria.html |date=12 October 2008 }}</ref>]]
The period from the 1940s through to 1963 was a period of respite for the Assyrians in northern Iraq and north east Syria. The regime of Iraqi President Kassim in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, a number of Assyrians moved south to cities such as [[Baghdad]], [[Basra]] and [[Nasiriyah]] to enhance their economic prospects, others were well represented in politics, the military, the arts and entertainment, Assyrian towns, villages, farmsteads and Assyrian quarters in major cities flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel and be over-represented in sports such as boxing, football, athletics, wrestling and swimming.

However, in 1963, the [[Ba'ath Party]] took power by force in Iraq, and came to power in Syria the same year. The Baathists, though secular, were [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalists]], and set about attempting to [[Arabization|Arabize]] the many non-Arab peoples of Iraq and Syria, including the Assyrians. This policy included refusing to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group, banning the publication of written material in Eastern Aramaic, and banning its teaching in schools, together with an attempt to ''Arabize'' the ancient pre-Arab heritage of Mesopotamian civilisation.

The policies of the Baathists have also long been mirrored in Turkey, whose nationalist governments have refused to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group since the 1920s, and have attempted to [[Turkification|Turkify]] the Assyrians by calling them "Semitic Turks" and forcing them to adopt Turkish names and language. In Baathist Syria too, the Assyrian (and Syriac-Aramean) Christians faced pressure to identify as "Arab Christians". In Iran, Assyrians continued to enjoy cultural, religious and ethnic rights, but due to the [[Islamic Revolution]] of 1979 their community has been diminished.

====ISIS (2012–present)====

In recent years, Assyrians in northern Iraq and north east Syria have become the target of attacks by Islamist militants like [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] and [[Nusra Front]].

==Culture==

Assyria continued to exist as a geopolitical entity until the Arab-Islamic conquest in the mid-7th century. Assyrian identity; personal, family and tribal names; and both the spoken and written evolution of [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] (which still contains many [[Akkadian]] loan words and an Akkadian grammatical structure) have survived among the Assyrian people from ancient times to this day. An [[Assyrian calendar]] has been revived.

===Language===

{{Main article|Sumerian language|Akkadian language|Aramaic language|Assyrian Neo-Aramaic}}
[[File:The part time of Assyrian King by F.A. Bridgman.jpg|thumb|''The pastime of an Assyrian King'' by F.A. Bridgman]]
Assyrian was a dialect of Akkadian language, a member of the eastern branch of the Semitic family and the oldest historically attested of the Semitic languages, which began to appear in written form in the 29th century BC. The first inscriptions in Assyria proper, called Old Assyrian (OA), were made in the Old Assyrian period.<ref>Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 188</ref>

During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and Akkadian-speakers, which included widespread [[bilingualism]].<ref name="Deutscher"/> The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.<ref name="Deutscher"/> This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.<ref name="Deutscher"/>

Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),<ref name="woods"/> but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

In the Neo-Assyrian period, the [[Aramaic language]] became increasingly common,<ref name="Roux 1964 308">Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 308.</ref> more so than Akkadian—this was thought to be largely due to the mass deportations undertaken by Assyrian kings,<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382">Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 382</ref> in which large Aramaic-speaking populations, conquered by the Assyrians, were relocated to Assyria and interbred with the Assyrians, and due to the fact that [[Tiglath-pileser II]] made it the [[lingua franca]] of Assyria and its empire in the 8th century BC.

The ancient Assyrians also used Sumerian in their literature and liturgy,<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382"/> although to a more limited extent in the Middle- and Neo-Assyrian periods, when Akkadian became the main literary language.<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382"/>

The destruction of the Assyrian capitals of Nineveh and Assur by the Babylonians, Medes and their allies, ensured that much of the bilingual elite (but not all) were wiped out. By the 7th century BC, much of the Assyrian population used distinct Akkadian influenced [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic varieties]] and not Akkadian itself. The last Akkadian inscriptions in Mesopotamia date from the 1st century AD. The [[Syriac language]] also emerged in Assyria during the 5th century BC, and during the Christian era, [[Syriac literature]] and [[Syriac script]] were to become hugely influential.

However, the descendant Eastern Aramaic dialects from the Neo-Assyrian Empire, as well as Akkadian and Mesopotamian Aramaic personal, tribal, family and place names, still survive to this day among [[Assyrian people]] in the regions of northern [[Iraq]], southeast [[Turkey]], northwest [[Iran]] and northeast [[Syria]] that constituted old Assyria, and are spoken fluently by up to 1,000,000 Assyrians, with a further number having lesser and varying degrees of fluency.<ref name="Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382"/> These dialects are very different from the now almost extinct [[Western Aramaic]] of the [[Arameans]] in the [[Levant]] and [[Transjordan (region)|Trans-Jordan]], which does not have an Akkadian grammatical structure or loan words.

After 90 years of effort, the [[University of Chicago]] in 2011 completed an Assyrian [[dictionary]], the style of which is more like an [[encyclopedia]] than a dictionary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/science/07dictionary.html|title=After 90 Years, a Dictionary of an Ancient World|date=7 June 2011|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

===Religion===

====Ancient Assyrian religion====
{{Main article|Ancient Mesopotamian religion}}
The Assyrians, like the rest of the Mesopotamian peoples, followed [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]], with their national god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] having the most importance to them during the Assyrian Empire. This religion gradually declined with the advent of Christianity between the first and tenth centuries.<ref name="nineveh.com"/>

Other major gods within the pantheon were [[Anu]], [[Baal]], [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]], [[Enlil]], [[Ishtar]] ([[Astarte]]), [[Shamash]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adad]]/[[Hadad]], [[Sin (mythology)|Sin (Nanna)]], [[Dagon|Dagan]], [[Ninurta]], [[Nisroch]], [[Nergal]], [[Tiamat]], [[Ninlil]], [[Mullissu]], [[Zababa]] and [[El (deity)|El]].

The original pagan religion of the Assyrians was widely adhered to until around the 4th century, and survived in pockets until at least the 10th century.<ref name="nineveh.com"/> However, Assyrians today are exclusively [[Christian]], with most following the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Syriac Catholic Church]], [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]]. Assyrians had begun to adopt [[Christianity]] (as well as for a time [[Manicheanism]] and [[gnosticism]]) between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD.

====Christian history of the Assyrian people====
The Assyrian people originally adhered to one of two Churches- The [[Assyrian Church of the East]], an [[East Syrian Rite]] Church, or the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], a [[West Syrian Rite]] Church. However, now there are nearly 20 different Assyrian Christian Churches including the ones followed by ethnically [[Malayali]] Converts in [[India]], known as [[St Thomas Christians]]. The first new Church formed around 100 years after the massacres by Timur during the 14th century due to the [[Schism of 1552]], which occurred among the Assyrians of northern Mesopotamia when a large number of Nestorian (followers of the Assyrian Church of the East) Assyrians in [[Diyarbakir|Amid]] elected a rival [[Patriarch]] named [[Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa]] after becoming dissatisfied with the leadership of the Assyrian Church (at this point based in [[Alqosh]]). Due to a need for an official ordination, Sulaqa went into communion with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] after at first failing to gain acceptance within the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]. Rome named this new church ''The Church of Assyria and Mosul'' and its first leader ''Patriarch of the East Assyrians'' in 1553 AD.

Soon after coming back Sulaqa was assassinated by supporters of the rival patriarch in Alqosh, but was able to form a new church structure and line of succession known as the Shimun Line prior to his death. This group of Assyrians eventually broke off ties with Rome, moved en masse to the Hakkari Mountains, and returned to the Nestorian faith they once adhered to prior to the Schism of 1552 (although the Shimun line still operated independently from the original Assyrian Church structure based in Alqosh).

A decade or so before the Shimun line broke off ties with Rome, another faction within the Assyrian Church entered into communion with Rome known as the Josephite line, and upon the Shimun line leaving, inherited the now vacant Church of Assyria and Mosul, which was renamed the "[[Chaldean Catholic Church]]" in 1683. This is now believed to be due to an error by the Catholic Church, but now due to that error their followers became known as [[Chaldean Catholics]] or [[Chaldo-Assyrians]] despite having no ethnic, historical, linguistic, cultural or geographic connections whatsoever to the by now long extinct Chaldean tribe of south east Mesopotamia.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Later on in the 1830s the original [[Assyrian Church of the East]] structure in Alqosh combined with the Chaldean Catholic Jacobite one, creating the modern Chaldean Catholic Church structure, which is ironic considering that the only remaining ethnic Assyrian Church to practice the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] denomination until this day is ruled by the Shimun line- the very first Church to split from the Assyrian Church of the East back in 1552. There was also another Nestorian Denomination known as the [[Ancient Church of the East]], which split from the Assyrian Church of the East due to reforms passed under the rule of [[Shimun XXIII Eshai]] in the 1960s, but with the election of [[Gewargis III]] in 2015 the churches had a reconciliation, and reunited.

The Syriac Orthodox Church also has a large number of ethnically Assyrian Adherents, who are known as ''[[Syriac Orthodox Christians (Middle East)|Syriacs]]''. The Syriac Orthodox Church has 5 million adherents across the globe, mostly in India, but is based in Damascus. However, since the 11th century it was based in the [[Saffron Monastery]] of [[Tur Abdin]], and prior to that it was based in [[Antakya|Antioch]]. Like the Nestorian churches, schisms also occurred within the Syriac Orthodox Church.

In 1626 [[Jesuit]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionaries began to proselytize among the Syriac Orthodox faithful at [[Aleppo]], forming a larger pro-catholic movement within the Syriac Orthodox Church. So in 1662, when the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate had fallen vacant, the Catholic party was able to elect one of its own, [[Ignatius Andrew Akijan|Andrew Akijan]] as Patriarch of the Syriac Church. This provoked a split in the community, and after Akijan’s death in 1677 two opposing patriarchs were elected, with one of those becoming the first Patriarch of the [[Syriac Catholic Church]]. This line of succession died out quickly, however, but in 1782 with the election of [[Ignatius Michael III Jarweh|Michael Jarweh]] as Patriarch the ''Ignatius'' line has been the head of the Syriac Catholic Church since then, and also has its base in [[Damascus]].

Some Assyrians converted to [[Protestantism]] during the 20th century as well, forming the [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]].

Therefore, by the end of all the schisms which occurred, the Assyrian people are now followers of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Syriac Catholic Church]], [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]]- in addition to even more sub churches which are located in India that are adherent to the mother sees in the Middle East.

===Architecture===

{{Main article|Architecture of Mesopotamia}}

Assyrian architecture, like that of Babylonia, was influenced by Sumero-Akkadian styles (and to some degree Mitanni), but early on developed its own distinctive style. Palaces sported colourful wall decorations, and seal-cutting (an art learned from Mittani) developed apace. Schools for scribes taught both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of Akkadian, and Sumerian and Akkadian literary works were often copied with an Assyrian flavour.

The Assyrian dialect of Akkadian was used in legal, official, religious, and practical texts such as medicine or instructions on manufacturing items. During the 13th to 10th centuries, picture tales appeared as a new art form: a continuous series of images carved on square stone steles. Somewhat reminiscent of a comic book, these show events such as warfare or hunting, placed in order from the upper left to the lower right corner of the stele with captions written underneath them. These and the excellent cut seals show that Assyrian art was beginning to surpass that of Babylon. Architecture saw the introduction of a new style of [[ziggurat]], with two towers and colorful enameled tiles.

===Arts and Sciences===

{{Main article|Art of Mesopotamia}}

[[File:Transport of cedar Dur Sharrukin.jpg|thumb|Relief from Assyrian capital of [[Dur Sharrukin]], showing transport of Lebanese cedar (8th century BC)]]
Assyrian art preserved to the present day predominantly dates to the Neo-Assyrian period. Art depicting battle scenes, and occasionally the impaling of whole villages in gory detail, was intended to show the power of the emperor, and was generally made for propaganda purposes. These stone reliefs lined the walls in the royal palaces where foreigners were received by the king. Other stone reliefs depict the king with different deities and conducting religious ceremonies. Many stone reliefs were discovered in the royal palaces at [[Nimrud]] (Kalhu) and [[Khorsabad]] (Dur-Sharrukin). A rare discovery of metal plates belonging to wooden doors was made at [[Balawat]] ([[Imgur-Enlil]]).

[[File:S03 06 01 017 image 2350.jpg|thumbnail|Assyria. Head of winged bull, 9th c. B.C.; Brooklyn Museum Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
Assyrian sculpture reached a high level of refinement in the Neo-Assyrian period. One prominent example is the winged bull [[lamassu]] or [[shedu]] that guard the entrances to the king's court. These were apotropaic meaning they were intended to ward off evil. C. W. Ceram states in ''The March of Archaeology'' that lamassi were typically sculpted with five legs so that four legs were always visible, whether the image were viewed frontally or in profile.

Although works of precious gems and metals usually do not survive the ravages of time, some fine pieces of Assyrian jewelry were found in royal tombs at Nimrud.

There is ongoing discussion among academics over the nature of the [[Nimrud lens]], a piece of [[quartz]] unearthed by [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1850, in the Nimrud palace complex in northern [[Iraq]]. A small minority believe that it is evidence for the existence of ancient Assyrian telescopes, which could explain the great accuracy of [[Assyrian astronomy]]. Other suggestions include its use as a magnifying glass for jewellers, or as a decorative furniture inlay. The Nimrud Lens is held in the British Museum.<ref name = "Muſeum">[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=369215&partid=1 Lens], British Museum.</ref>

The Assyrians were also innovative in military technology, with the use of heavy cavalry, sappers, siege engines etc.

[[File:Layard Nineveh.jpg|thumb|[[Austen Henry Layard]] in [[Nineveh]], 1852]]

[[Achaemenid Assyria]] (539–330 BC) retained a separate identity, official correspondence being in [[Imperial Aramaic]], and there was even a determined revolt of the two Assyrian provinces of Mada and Athura in 520 BC. Under Seleucid rule, however, Aramaic gave way to [[Greek language|Greek]] as the official administrative language. Aramaic was marginalised as an official language, but remained spoken in both Assyria and Babylonia by the general populace. It also remained the spoken tongue of the indigenous Assyrian/Babylonian citizens of all Mesopotamia under Persian, Greek and Roman rule, and indeed well into the Arab period it was still the language of the majority, particularly in the north of Mesopotamia, surviving to this day among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christians.

Between 150 BC and 226 AD, Assyria changed hands between the [[Parthian Empire]] and the Romans until coming under the rule of the [[Sasanian Empire]] from 226–651, where it was known as [[Asōristān]].

A number of at least partly neo-Assyrian kingdoms existed in the area between in the late classical and early Christian period also; [[Adiabene]], [[Hatra]] and [[Osroene]].

[[Mesopotamia in Classical literature|Classical historiographers]] and Biblical writers had only retained a fragmented, very dim and often inaccurate picture of Assyria. It was remembered that there had been an Assyrian empire predating the Persian one, but all particulars were lost. Thus Jerome's ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' lists 36 kings of the Assyrians, beginning with [[Ninus]], son of [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]], down to [[Sardanapalus]], the last king of the Assyrians before the empire fell to [[Arbaces]] the Median. Almost none of these have been substantiated as historical, with the exception of the Neo-Assyrian and Babylonian rulers listed in the ''[[Canon of Kings]]'', beginning with [[Nabonassar]].

The Assyrians began to form and adopt a distinct [[Eastern Christianity]], with its accompanying [[Syriac literature]], between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD; however, [[ancient Mesopotamian religion]] was still alive and well into the fourth century and pockets survived into the 10th century and possibly as late as the 17th century in [[Mardin]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} However, the religion is now dead, and the Assyrian people, though still retaining Eastern Aramaic dialects as a mother tongue, are now wholly Christian.

The [[Assyriology#History of the field|modern discovery of Babylonia and Assyria]] begins with excavations in [[Nineveh]] in 1845, which revealed the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]]. Decipherment of the [[cuneiform script]] was a formidable task that took more than a decade; but, by 1857, the [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]] was convinced that reliable reading of cuneiform texts was possible. [[Assyriology]] has since pieced together the formerly largely forgotten history of Mesopotamia. In the wake of the archaeological and philological rediscovery of ancient Assyria, [[Assyrian nationalism]] became increasingly popular among the surviving remnants of the [[Assyrian people]], who have come to strongly identify with ancient Assyria.
