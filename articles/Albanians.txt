{{Albanians}}
'''Albanians''' ({{lang-sq|Shqiptarët}}) are an [[ethnic group]] native to [[Albania]] and neighboring countries. The term is also used to refer to the citizens of the Republic of Albania.<ref name= Ed>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/file_download/series/277_citizenshipinanemigrantnationstatethecaseofalbania.pdf |title=Citizenship in an emigrant nation-state: the case of Albania |author=Gëzim Krasniqi |date= |work= |publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]]|accessdate=7 August 2012|pages=9–14}}</ref> Ethnic Albanians speak the [[Albanian language]] and more than half of ethnic Albanians live in [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]].{{efn|name=status}} A large Albanian population lives in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], with smaller Albanian populations located in Serbia and Montenegro. The majority of Albanians are nominally  [[Islam|Muslim]] (mainly [[Sunni]], with a smaller [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Bektashi]] component), and a minority are nominally  [[Christian]] ([[Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]). Albanians produced many prominent figures such as [[Skanderbeg]], leader of the medieval Albanian resistance to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest and others during the [[Albanian National Awakening]] seeking self-determination. During the 17th and 18th century Albanians in large numbers converted to [[Islam]], often to escape higher taxes levied on Christian subjects.<ref name="Vickers2011">{{harvnb|Vickers|2011|pp=17–24}}.</ref><ref name="Giakoumis8788">{{harvnb|Giakoumis|2010|pp=87–88}}.</ref><ref name="Ramet203204">{{harvnb|Ramet|1998|pp=203–204}}.</ref> As Muslims, some Albanians attained important political and military positions within the Ottoman Empire and culturally contributed to the wider Muslim world.<ref name="Clayer"/> Albania gained its independence in 1912 and between 1945-1992, Albanians lived under a repressive communist regime. Albanians within [[Yugoslavia]] underwent periods of discrimination and eventual self-determination that concluded with the breakup of that state in the early 1990s culminating with Albanians living in new countries and Kosovo. Outside the southwestern Balkans of where Albanians have traditionally been located, Albanian populations through the course of history have formed new communities contributing to the cultural, economic, social and political life of their host populations and countries while also at times assimilating too.

Between the 11th and 18th centuries, sizable numbers of Albanians migrated from the area of contemporary Albania to escape either various socio-political difficulties and/or the Ottoman conquest.<ref name="Riehl238">{{harvnb|Riehl|2010|p=238}}. "Other interesting groups in the context of European migration include the Albanians who from the thirteenth century immigrated to Greece (i.e., the so-called "Arvanites", see Sasse 1998) and to Southern Italy (Calabria, Sicily, cf Breu 2005)."</ref><ref name="Nasse2426"/><ref name="Gogonas3"/><ref name="Hall2829"/> One population which became the [[Arvanites]] settled down in southern Greece who starting from the 16th century though mainly during the 19th century onwards assimilated and today self identify as Greeks.<ref name="Hall2829"/><ref name="Bintliff137138"/><ref name="Liakos230">{{harvnb|Liakos|2012|p=230}}.

"While the bulk of stradioti rank and file were of Albanian origin from Greece, by the middle of the 16th century there is evidence that many had become Hellenized or even Italianized... Hellenization was perhaps well on its way prior to service abroad, since Albanian stradioti had settled in Greek lands for two generations prior to their emigration to Italy. Since many served under Greek commanders and served together with Greek stradioti, the process continued. Another factor in this assimilative process was the stradioti's and their families' active involvement and affiliation with the Greek Orthodox or Uniate Church communities in Naples, Venice and elsewhere. Hellenization thus occurred as a result of common service and church affiliation."</ref><ref name="VeremisKolipoulos2425"/> Another population, who became the [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]] settled in southern Italy<ref name="Nasse2426"/> and form the oldest continuous [[Albanian diaspora]] producing influential and many prominent figures.

"Možemo reći da svi na neki način pripadamo nekoj vrsti etničke kategorije, a često i više nego jednoj. Kao primjer navodim slučaj zadarskih Arbanasa. Da bismo shvatili Arbanase i problem njihova etnojezičnog (etničkog i jezičnog) identiteta, potrebno je ići u povijest njihova doseljenja koje seže u početak 18. st., tj. točnije: razdoblje od prve seobe 1726., razdoblje druge seobe od 1733., pa sve do 1754. godine koja se smatra završnom godinom njihova doseljenja. Svi su se doselili iz tri sela s područja Skadarskog jezera - Briske, Šestana i Livara. Bježeći od Turaka, kuge i ostalih nevolja, generalni providur Nicola Erizzo II dozvolio im je da se nasele u područje današnjih Arbanasa i Zemunika. Jedan dio stanovništva u Zemuniku se asimilirao s ondašnjim stanovništvom zaboravivši svoj jezik. To su npr. današnji Prenđe, Šestani, Ćurkovići, Paleke itd. Drugi dio stanovništva je nastojao zadržati svoj etnički i jezični identitet tijekom ovih 280 godina. Dana 10. svibnja 2006. godine obilježena je 280. obljetnica njihova dolaska u predgrađe grada Zadra. Nije bilo lako, osobito u samom početku, jer nisu imali svoju crkvu, škole itd., pa je jedini način održavanja njihova identiteta i jezika bio usmenim putem. We can say that all in some way belong to a kind of ethnic category, and often more than one. As an example, I cite the case of Zadar Arbanasi. To understand the problem of the Albanians and their ethnolinguistic (ethnic and linguistic) identity, it is necessary to go into the history of their immigration that goes back to the beginning of the 18th century., etc more precisely: the period from the first migration of 1726, the period of the second migration of 1733, and until 1754, which is considered to be the final year of their immigration. All they moved from three villages from the area of Lake Scutari - Briska, Šestan and Livara. Fleeing from the Ottomans, plague and other troubles, the general provider Nicola Erizzo II allowed them to settle in the area of today's Arbanasa and Zemunik. One part of the population in Zemunik became assimilated with the local population, forgetting their language. These are for example, today's Prenda, Šestani, Ćurkovići, Paleke etc. The second part of the population tried to maintain their ethnic and linguistic identity during these 280 years. On May 10, 2006 marked the 280th anniversary of their arrival in the suburb of Zadar. It was not easy, especially in the beginning, because they did not have their own church, school, etc., and is the only way to maintain their identity and language was verbally."</ref><ref name="Novik261262">{{harvnb|Novik|2015|pp=261–262}}. "Historical Facts. Four villages with Albanian population are located in the Ukraine: Karakurt (Zhovtnevoe) set up in 1811 (Odessa region), Tyushki (Georgievka), Dzhandran (Gammovka) and Taz (Devninskoe) set up in 1862 (Zaporizh’a region). Before migrating to the territory of the Russian empire, Albanians had moved from the south-east of the present day Albania into Bulgaria (Varna region) because of the Osmanli invasion (Державин, 1914, 1926, 1933, 1948, pp. 156–169). Three hundred years later they had moved from Bulgaria to the Russian empire on account of Turkish-Russian opposition in the Balkan Peninsula. Ethnic Albanians also live in Moldova, Odessa and St. Petersburg. Present Day Situation. Nowadays, in the Ukraine and Russia there are an estimated 5000 ethnic Albanians. They live mainly in villages situated in the Odessa and Zaporizh’a regions. The language and many elements of traditional culture are still preserved and maintained in four Albanian villages (Будина, 2000, pp. 239–255; Иванова, 2000, pp. 40–53). From the ethnolinguistic and linguistic point of view these Albanian villages are of particular interest and value since they are excellent examples of a "melting pot" (Иванова, 1995, 1999). Bulgarians and Gagauzes live side by side with Albanians in Karakurt; Russians and Ukrainians share the same space with Albanians in the Azov Sea region. It is worth mentioning that in these multi-lingual environments, the Albanian patois retains original Balkan features."</ref>

The Albanian diaspora also exists in a number of other countries. The largest of these is located in Turkey. It was formed during the Ottoman era through economic migration and early years of the Turkish republic through migration due to sociopolitical discrimination and violence experienced by Albanians in [[Balkans|Balkan countries]].<ref name="GenisMaynard553555"/> Due to the Ottoman legacy, smaller populations of Albanians also exist in Egypt and the [[Levant]], in particular Syria.<ref name="Norris209210"/> In Western countries, a large and influential Albanian population exists in the United States formed from continuous emigration dating back to the 19th century. Other Albanians populations due to emigration between the 19th and 21th centuries are located in Australia, Argentina, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, Belgium, United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, Italy, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Austria, Netherlands, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania.

''Shqiptarë''; the name "Albanians" ([[Byzantine Greek]]: ''Albanoi/Arbanitai/Arbanites'';  [[Latin]]: ''Albanenses/Arbanenses'') was used in medieval Greek and Latin documents that gradually entered European languages from which other similar derivative names emerged.<ref name="Elsie200534"/> From these [[ethnonym]]s, names for Albanians were also derived in other languages that were or still are in use.<ref name="Lloshi277"/><ref name="BardhylDemiraj534"/><ref name="Kamusella241"/> In English ''Albanians''; Italian ''Albanesi''; German ''Albaner''; Greek ''Arvanites'', ''Alvanitis'' (Αλβανίτης) plural: ''Alvanites'' (Αλβανίτες), ''Alvanos'' (Αλβανός) plural: ''Alvanoi'' (Αλβανοί); Turkish ''Arnaut'', ''Arnavut''; [[South Slavic languages]] ''Arbanasi'', ''Albanci'' (Албанци); [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] ''Arbineş'' and so on.<ref name="Liotta198">{{harvnb|Liotta|2001|p=198}}. "Among Greeks, the term "Alvanitis"—or "Arvanitis"—means a Christian of Albanian ancestry, one who speaks both Greek and Albanian, but possesses Greek "consciousness." Numerous "Arvanites" live in Greece today, although the ability to speak both languages is shrinking as the differences (due to technology and information access and vastly different economic bases) between Greece and Albania increase. The Greek communities of Elefsis, Marousi, Koropi, Keratea, and Markopoulo (all in the Attikan peninsula) once held significant Arvanite communities. "Arvanitis" is not necessarily a pejorative term; a recent Pan Hellenic socialist foreign minister spoke both Albanian and Greek (but not English). A former Greek foreign minister, Theodoros Pangalos, was an "Arvanite" from Elefsis."</ref><ref name="Lloshi277"/><ref name="BardhylDemiraj534">{{harvnb|Demiraj|2010|p=534}}.

"Their traditional designation, based on a root *''alban''- and its rhotacized variants *''arban''-, *''albar''-, and *''arbar''-, appears from the eleventh century onwards in Byzantine chronicles (''Albanoi'', ''Arbanitai'', ''Arbanites''), and from the fourteenth century onwards in Latin and other Western documents (''Albanenses'', ''Arbanenses'')."</ref><ref name="Lloshi277"/> The Albanian language was referred to as ''Arbnisht'' and ''Arbërisht''.<ref name="MënikuCampos2">{{harvnb|Mëniku|Campos|2012|p=2}}. "Albanian is an Indo-European language, but like modern Greek and Armenian, it does not have any other closely related living language. Within the Indo-European family, it forms a group of its own. In Albanian, the language is called shqip. Albania is called ''Shqipëri'', and the Albanians call themselves ''shqiptarë''. Until the fifteenth century the language was known as ''Arbërisht'' or ''Arbnisht'', which is still the name used for the language in Italy and Greece. The Greeks refer to all the varieties of Albanian spoken in Greece as Arvanitika. In the second century AD, Ptolemy, the Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer and geographer, used the name ''Albanoi'' to refer to an Illyrian tribe that used to live in what is now central Albania. During the Middle Ages the population of that area was referred to as ''Arbanori'' or ''Albanon''. It is clear that the words ''Arbëresh'', ''Arvanitika'', and even ''Albanian'' and ''Albania'' are all related to the older name of the language."</ref> While the [[exonym]] Albania for the general region inhabited by the Albanians does have connotations to Classical Antiquity, the Albanian language employs a different ethnonym, with modern Albanians referring to themselves as ''Shqip(ë)tarë'' and to their country as ''Shqipëria''.<ref name="Lloshi277"/> Two etymologies have been proposed for this ethnonym: one, derived from the etymology from the Albanian word for eagle (shqipe, var.,shqiponjë).<ref name="Kamusella241"/> In Albanian [[folk etymology]], this word denotes a bird [[totem]], dating from the times of Skanderbeg as displayed on the [[Albanian flag]].<ref name="Kamusella241"/><ref name="ej2-s">{{cite encyclopedia | title=ALBANCI | encyclopedia =[[Enciklopedija Jugoslavije]] 2nd ed. | volume=Supplement | pages=1 | publisher=[[JLZ]] | location=[[Zagreb]] | year=1984 }}</ref> The other is within scholarship that connects it to the verb 'to speak' (''me shqiptue'') from the Latin "''excipere''".<ref name="Kamusella241"/> In this instance the Albanian endonym like ''[[Slav (ethnonym)|Slav]]'' [[Endonym#Tendencies in the development of exonyms|and others]] would originally have been a term connoting "those who speak [intelligibly, the same language]".<ref name="Kamusella241">{{harvnb|Kamusella|2009|p=241}}. "Prior to the emergence of the modern self-ethnonym ''Shqiptarë'' in the mid-16th century (for the first time it was recorded in 1555 by the Catholic Gheg, Gjon Buzuku, in his missal), North Albanians (Ghegs) referred to themselves as ''Arbën'', and South Albanians (Tosks) ''Arbër''. Hence, the self-ethnonym ''Arbëreshë'' of the present-day Italo-Albanians (numbering about 100,000) in southern Italy and Sicily, whose ancestors, in the wake of the Ottoman wars, emigrated from their homeland in the 14th century. These self-ethnonyms perhaps influenced the Byzantine Greek Arvanites for ‘Albanians,’ which was followed by similar ones in Bulgarian and Serbian (''Arbanasi''), Ottoman (''Arnaut''), Romanian (''Arbănas''), and Aromanian (''Arbineş''). It is clear that scholars and Albanians themselves agree that they do not agree on any single etymology of the ethnonym ‘Albanian.’ A similar predicament is faced by the self-ethnonym ''Shqiptarë''. The most popular scholarly explanation is that it was formed by analogy to ‘Slavs’ (*''Slovene''), believed to be derived from ''slovo'' (‘word’), and by extension, from *''sluti'' (‘to speak clearly.’) The last explanation semantically contrasts with Slavic ''Niemiec'' (‘mute,’‘stammering,’‘babbling’), and Greek ‘barbarian’ (from ''barbaros'' ‘those who stammer, babble’). Hence, ''Shqiptarë'' could be derived from Albanian ''shqipoi'' (from Latin ''excipere'') for ‘to speak clearly, to understand.’ The Albanian public favors the belief that their self-ethnonym stems from ''shqipe'' (‘eagle’) found on the Albanian national flag."</ref> The new ethnonyms ''Shqip(ë)tarë'' and ''Shqipëria'' emerged and replaced the older ethnonyms ''Arbëneshë/Arbëreshë'' and ''Arbënia/Arbëria'' between the late 17th and early 18th centuries.<ref name="Lloshi277"/> That era brought about religious and other sociopolitical changes.<ref name="Lloshi277"/> As such a new and generalised response by Albanians based on ethnic and linguistic consciousness to this new and different Ottoman world emerging around them was a change in ethnonym.<ref name="Lloshi277">{{harvnb|Lloshi|1999|p=277}}. "The Albanians of today call themselves ''shqiptarë'', their country ''Shqipëri'', and their language ''shqipe''. These terms came into use between the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. Foreigners call them ''albanesi'' (Italian), ''Albaner'' (German), ''Albanians'' (English), ''Alvanos'' (Greek), and ''Arbanasi'' (old Serbian), the country ''Albania'', ''Albanie'', ''Albanien'', ''Alvania'', and ''Albanija'', and the language ''Albanese'', ''Albanisch'', ''Albanian'', ''Alvaniki'', and ''Arbanashki'' respectively. All these words are derived from the name ''Albanoi'' of an Illyrian tribe and their center ''Albanopolis'', noted by the astronomer of Alexandria, Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD. ''Alban'' could he a plural of ''alb''- ''arb''-, denoting the inhabitants of the plains (ÇABEJ 1976). The name passed over the boundaries of the Illyrian tribe in central Albania, and was generalised for all the Albanians. They called themselves ''arbënesh'', ''arbëresh'', the country ''Arbëni'', ''Arbëri'', and the language ''arbëneshe'', ''arbëreshe''. In the foreign languages, the Middle Ages denominations of these names survived, but for the Albanians they were substituted by ''shqiptarë'', ''Shqipëri'' and ''shqipe''. The primary root is the adverb ''shqip'', meaning "clearly, intelligibly". There is a very close semantic parallel to this in the German noun ''Deutsche'', "the Germans" and "the German language" (Lloshi 1984) Shqip spread out from the north to the south, and ''Shqipni/Shqipëri'' is probably a collective noun, following the common pattern of ''Arbëni'', ''Arbëri''. The change happened after the Ottoman conquest because of the conflict in the whole line of the political, social, economic, religious, and cultural spheres with a totally alien world of the Oriental type. A new and more generalised ethnic and linguistic consciousness of all these people responded to this."</ref>

Studies in genetic anthropology show that the Albanians share the same ancestry as most other European peoples.<ref name="Belledi480486">{{harvnb|Belledi|Poloni|Casalotti|Conterio|2000|pp=480–486}}. "Mitochondrial DNA HV1 sequences and Y chromosome haplotypes (DYS19 STR and YAP) were characterized in an Albanian sample and compared with those of several other Indo-European populations from the European continent. No significant difference was observed between Albanians and most other Europeans, despite the fact that Albanians are clearly different from all other Indo-Europeans linguistically. We observe a general lack of genetic structure among Indo-European populations for both maternal and paternal polymorphisms, as well as low levels of correlation between linguistics and genetics, even though slightly more significant for the Y chromosome than for mtDNA. Altogether, our results show that the linguistic structure of continental Indo-European populations is not reflected in the variability of the mitochondrial and Y chromosome markers. This discrepancy could be due to very recent differentiation of Indo-European populations in Europe and/or substantial amounts of gene flow among these populations."</ref>

===Albanians in the Middle Ages===

What is possibly the earliest written reference to the Albanians is that to be found in an old Bulgarian text compiled around the beginning of the 11th century.<ref name="Elsie3"/> It was discovered in a Serbian manuscript dated 1628 and was first published in 1934 by Radoslav Grujic. This fragment of a legend from the time of [[Tsar Samuel]] endeavours, in a catechismal 'question and answer' form, to explain the origins of peoples and languages. It divides the world into seventy-two languages and three religious categories: Orthodox, half-believers (i.e. non-Orthodox Christians) and non-believers. The Albanians find their place among the nations of half-believers. If the dating of Grujic is accepted, which is based primarily upon the contents of the text as a whole, this would be the earliest written document referring to the Albanians as a people or language group.<ref name="Elsie3">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=3}}.</ref>

<blockquote>It can be seen that there are various languages on earth. Of them, there are five Orthodox languages: Bulgarian, Greek, Syrian, Iberian (Georgian) and Russian. Three of these have Orthodox alphabets: Greek, Bulgarian and Iberian. There are twelve languages of half-believers: Alamanians, [[Franks]], Magyars (Hungarians), Indians, Jacobites, Armenians, [[Saxons]], Lechs (Poles), '''Arbanasi''' (Albanians), Croatians, Hizi, Germans.</blockquote>

The first undisputed mention of Albanians in the historical record is attested in Byzantine source for the first time in 1079–1080, in a work titled ''History'' by Byzantine historian [[Michael Attaliates]], who referred to the ''Albanoi'' as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]] in 1043 and to the ''Arbanitai'' as subjects of the duke of [[Durrës|Dyrrachium]]. It is disputed, however, whether the "Albanoi" of the events of 1043 refers to Albanians in an ethnic sense or whether "Albanoi" is a reference to [[Normans]] from [[Sicily]] under an archaic name (there was also a tribe in Italy by the name of "Albanoi").<ref name="MadgearuGordon25b"/> However a later reference to Albanians from the same Attaleiates, regarding the participation of Albanians in a rebellion around 1078, is undisputed.<ref name="MadgearuGordon25"/> At this point, they are already fully Christianized, although [[Albanian mythology]] and folklore are part of the [[Paleo-Balkan mythology|Paleo-Balkan]] pagan mythology,<ref name="Bonnefoy253">{{harvnb|Bonnefoy|1993|p=253}}.</ref> in particular showing Greek influence.<ref name="EliadeAdams179">{{harvnb|Eliade|Adams|1987|p=179}}.</ref>

In the 14th century a number of [[Albanian principalities]] were created. These included [[Principality of Kastrioti]], [[Principality of Dukagjini]], [[Principality of Albania (medieval)|Princedom of Albania]], and [[Principality of Gjirokastër]]. At the beginning of the 15th century these principalities became stronger, especially because of the fall of the [[Serbian Empire]].

===Albanians under the Ottoman Empire===

At the dawn of the establishment of the Ottoman Empire in Southeast Europe, the geopolitical landscape was marked by scattered kingdoms of small principalities. The Ottomans erected their garrisons throughout southern Albania by 1415 and established formal jurisdiction over most of Albania by 1431.<ref>Licursi, Emiddio Pietro (2011). Empire of Nations: The Consolidation of Albanian and Turkish National Identities in theLate Ottoman Empire, 1878–1913. New York: Columbia University. p. 19.</ref> However, in 1443 a great and longstanding revolt broke under the lead of the Albanian national hero Skanderbeg, which lasted until 1479, many times defeating major Ottoman armies led by sultans [[Murad II]] and [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]]. Skanderbeg united initially the Albanian princes and later established a centralized authority over most of the non-conquered territories, becoming Lord of Albania. He also tried relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to create a European coalition against the Ottomans. He frustrated every attempt by the Turks to regain Albania, which they envisioned as a springboard for the invasion of Italy and western Europe. His unequal fight against the mightiest power of the time won the esteem of Europe as well as some support in the form of money and military aid from Naples, the papacy, [[Venice]], and [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]].<ref name="britannica">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12472/Albania/42646/The-decline-of-Byzantium|title=Albania :: The decline of Byzantium -- Encyclopedia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref> Finally after decades of resistance, Ottomans captured [[Siege of Shkodra|Shkodër in 1479]] and Durrës in 1501.<ref>Barletius, Marinus.

Albanians were recruited all over Europe as a light cavalry known as [[stratioti]]. The stratioti were pioneers of light cavalry tactics during this era. In the early 16th century heavy cavalry in the European armies was principally remodeled after Albanian stradioti of the Venetian army, Hungarian [[hussar]]s and German mercenary cavalry units (Schwarzreitern).<ref>Downing 1992, p. 66.</ref>
By the 16th century, Ottoman rule over Southeast Europe was largely secure. The Ottomans proceeded in stages, first appointing a [[qadi]] along with governors and then military retainers in the cities. [[Timar]] holders, not necessarily converts to Islam, would occasionally rebel, the most famous case of which is [[Skanderbeg]]. His figure would be used later in the 19th century as a central component of Albanian national identity.

By the 1870s, the [[Sublime Porte]]'s reforms aimed at checking the Ottoman Empire's disintegration had clearly failed. The image of the "Turkish yoke" had become fixed in the nationalist mythologies and psyches of the empire's Balkan peoples, and their march toward independence quickened. Because of the higher degree of Islamic influence, the Albanians internal social divisions, and the fear that they would lose their Albanian-populated lands to the emerging Balkan states—[[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Greece]]—were the last of the Balkan peoples to desire division from the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="Birth of Albania">{{cite web|editor1=Raymond Zickel|editor2=Walter R.

The Albanian presence in Kosovo and in the adjacent [[Toplica District|Toplica]] and [[Moravac|Morava]] regions is recorded since the medieval period.<ref name="Anscombe767774785788">{{harvnb|Anscombe|2006b|pp=767–774}}, 785-788. "While the ethnic roots of some settlements can be determined from the Ottoman records, Serbian and Albanian historians have at times read too much into them in their running dispute over the ethnic history of early Ottoman Kosovo. Their attempts to use early Ottoman provincial surveys (tahrir defterleri) to gauge the ethnic make—up of the population in the fifteenth century have proved little. Leaving aside questions arising from the dialects and pronunciation of the census scribes, interpreters, and even priests who baptized those recorded, no natural law binds ethnicity to name. Imitation, in which the customs, tastes, and even names of those in the public eye are copied by the less exalted, is a time—tested tradition and one followed in the Ottoman Empire. Some Christian sipahis in early Ottoman Albania took such Turkic names as Timurtaş, for example, in a kind of cultural conformity completed later by conversion to Islam. Such cultural mimicry makes onomastics an inappropriate tool for anyone wishing to use Ottoman records to prove claims so modern as to have been irrelevant to the pre—modern state. The seventeenth—century Ottoman notable arid author Evliya Çelebi, who wrote a massive account of his travels around the empire and abroad, included in it details of local society that normally would not appear in official correspondence; for this reason his account of a visit to several towns in Kosovo in 1660 is extremely valuable. Evliya confirms that western and at least parts of central Kosovo were ‘Arnavud’. He notes that the town of Vučitrn had few speakers of ‘Boşnakca’; its inhabitants spoke Albanian or Turkish. He terms the highlands around Tetovo (in Macedonia), Peć, and Prizren the ‘mountains of Arnavudluk’. Elsewhere, he states that ‘the mountains of Peć’ lay in Arnavudluk, from which issued one of the rivers converging at Mitrovica, just north-west of which he sites Kosovo's border with Bosna. This river, the Ibar, flows from a source in the mountains of Montenegro north—north—west of Peć, in the region of Rozaje to which the Këlmendi would later be moved. He names the other river running by Mitrovica as the Kılab and says that it, too, had its source in Aravudluk; by this he apparently meant the Lab, which today is the name of the river descending from mountains north—east of Mitrovica to join the Sitnica north of Priština. As Evliya travelled south, he appears to have named the entire stretch of river he was following the Kılab, not noting the change of name when he took the right fork at the confluence of the Lab and Sitnica. Thus, Evliya states that the tomb of Murad I, killed in the battle of Kosovo Polje, stood beside the Kılab, although it stands near the Sitnica outside Priština. Despite the confusion of names, Evliya included in Arnavudluk not only the western fringe of Kosovo, but also the central mountains from which the Sitnica (‘Kılab’) and its first tributaries descend. Given that a large Albanian population lived in Kosovo, especially in the west and centre, both before and after the Habsburg invasion of 1689-90, it remains possible, in theory, that at that time in the Ottoman Empire, one people emigrated en masse and another immigrated to take its place.</ref> As the Serbs expelled a large number of Albanians from the wider Toplica and Morava regions in southern Serbia, which the [[Congress of Berlin]] of 1878 had given to the [[Belgrade|Belgrade Principality]], a large number of them settled in Kosovo.<ref name="Jagodic">{{harvnb|Jagodić|1998}}. para. 1-71.</ref> In Kosovo they and their descendants are known as ''muhaxher'' (meaning ''the exiled'', from the Arabic muhajir).<ref name="Uka525354">{{harvnb|Uka|2004d|p=52}}.

The [[Arvanites]] and [[Albanian-speakers of Western Thrace]] are a group descended from [[Tosks]] who migrated to southern and central Greece between the 13th and 16th centuries.<ref name="Gogonas3">{{harvnb|Gogonas|2010|p=3}}. "Arvanites originate from Albanian settlers who moved south at different times between the 14th and the 16th centuries from areas in what is today southern Albania The reasons for this migration are not entirely clear and may be manifold. In many instances the Arvanites were invited by the Byzantine and Latin rulers of the time. They were employed to resettle areas that had been largely depopulated through wars, epidemics and other reasons, and they were employed as soldiers. Some later movements are also believed to have been motivated to evade Islamisation after the Ottoman conquest. The main waves of the Arvanite migration into southern Greece started around 1300, reached a peak some time during the 14th century, and ended around 1600. Arvanites first reached Thessaly, then Attica and finally the Peloponnese (Clogg. 2002). Regarding the number of Arvanites in Greece, the 1951 census (the last census in Greece that included a question about language) gives a figure of 23.000 Arvaiithka speakers. Sociohinguistic research in the 1970s in the villages of Attica and Biotia alone indicated a figure of at least 30.000 speakers (Trudgill and Tzavaras 1977), while Lunden (1993) suggests 50.000 for Greece as a whole."</ref> They are Greek Orthodox Christians, and though they traditionally speak a dialect of [[Tosk Albanian]] known as [[Arvanitika]], they have fully assimilated into the Greek nation and do not identify as Albanians.<ref name="Hall2829">{{harvnb|Hall|1997|pp=28–29}}. "The permeability of ethnic boundaries is also demonstrated in many of the Greek villages of Attiki and Viotia (ancient Attika and Boiotia), where Arvanites often form a majority) These Arvanites are descended from Albanians who first entered Greece between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries (though there was a subsequent wave of immigration in the second half of the eighteenth century). Although still regarded as ethnically distinct in the nineteenth century, their participation in the Greek War of Independence and the Civil War has led to increasing assimilation: in a survey conducted in the 1970s, 97 per crnt of Arvanite informants despite regularly speaking in Arvanitika, considered themselves to be Greek. A similar concern with being identified as Greek is exhibited by the bilingual Arvanites of the Eastern Argolid."</ref><ref name="Bintliff137138">{{harvnb|Bintliff|2003|pp=137–138}}. "First, we can explain the astonishing persistence of Albanian village culture from the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries through the ethnic and religious tolerance characteristic of Islamic empires and so lacking in their Christian equivalents. Ottoman control rested upon allowing local communities to keep their religion, language, local laws, and representatives, provided that taxes were paid (the millet system). There was no pressure for Greeks and Albanians to conform to each other's language or other behavior.
Clear signs of change are revealed in the travel diaries of the German scholar Ludwig Ross (1851), when he accompanied the Bavarian Otto, whom the Allies had foisted as king upon the newly freed Greek nation in the aftermath of the War of Independence in the 1830s. Ross praises the well-built Greek villages of central Greece with their healthy, happy, dancing inhabitants, and contrasts them specifically with the hovels and sickly inhabitants of Albanian villages. In fact, recent scholarship has underlined how far it was the West that built modem Greece in its own fanciful image as the land of a long-oppressed people who were the direct descendants of Pericles.
Thus from the late nineteenth century onward the children of the inhabitants of the new "nation-state" were taught in Greek, history confined itself to the episodes of pure Greekness, and the tolerant Ottoman attitude to cultural diversity yielded to a deliberate policy of total Hellenization of the populace—effective enough to fool the casual observer. One is rather amazed at the persistence today of such dual-speaking populations in much of the Albanian colonization zone. However, apart from the provinciality of this essentially agricultural province, a high rate of illiteracy until well into this century has also helped to preserve Arvanitika in the Boeotian villagers (Meijs 1993)."; p. 140. "In contrast therefore to the more openly problematic issue of Slav speakers in northern Greece, Arvanitic speakers in central Greece lack any signs of an assertive ethnicity. I would like to suggest that they possess what we might term a ''passive ethnicity''. As a result of a number of historical factors, much of the rural population in central Greece was Albanian-speaking by the time of the creation of the modern Greek state in the 1830s. Until this century, most of these people were illiterate and unschooled, yet there existed sufficient knowledge of Greek to communicate with officials and townspeople, itinerant traders, and so on, to limit the need to transform rural language usage. Life was extremely provincial, with just one major carriage-road passing through the center of the large province of Boeotia even in the 1930s (beyond which horseback and cart took over; van Effenterre 1989). Even in the 1960s, Arvanitic village children could be figures of fun for their Greek peers in the schools of Thebes (One of the two regional towns) (K. Sarri, personal communication, 2000). It was not a matter of cultural resistance but simple conservatism and provinciality, the extreme narrowness of rural life, that allowed Arvanitic language and local historic memories to survive so effectively to the very recent period."</ref><ref name="VeremisKolipoulos2425">{{harvnb|Veremis|Kolipoulos|2003|pp=24–25}}. "For the time being, the Greeks of free Greece could indulge in defining their brethren of unredeemed Greece, primarily the Slav Macedonians and secondarily the Orthodox Albanians and the Vlachs. Primary school students were taught, in the 1880s, that ‘Greeks [are] our kinsmen, of common descent, speaking the language we speak and professing the religion we profess’." But this definition, it seems, was reserved for small children who could not possibly understand the intricate arguments of their parents on the question of Greek identity. What was essential to understand at that tender age was that modern Greeks descended from the ancient Greeks. Grown up children, however, must have been no less confused than adults on the criteria for defining modern Greek identity. Did the Greeks constitute a ‘race’ apart from the Albanians, the Slavs and the Vlachs? Yes and no. High school students were told that the ‘other races’, i.e. the Slavs, the Albanians and the Vlachs, ‘having been Hellenized with the years in terms of mores and customs, are now being assimilated into the Greeks’. On the Slavs of Macedonia there seems to have been no consensus. Were they Bulgars, Slavicized Greeks or early Slavs? They ‘were’ Bulgars until the 1870s and Slavicized Greeks, or Hellenized Slavs subsequently, according to the needs of the dominant theory. There was no consensus, either, on the Vlachs. Were they Latinized Greek mountaineers of late immigrants from Vlachia? As in the case of the Slavs of Macedonia, Vlach descent shifted from the southern Balkans to the Danube, until the Romanians claimed the Vlachs for their brethren; which made the latter irrevocably indigenous to the southern Balkan mountains. The Albanians or ‘Arvanites’, were readily ‘adopted’ as brethren of common descent for at least three reasons. Firstly, the Albanians had been living in southern Greece, as far south as the Peloponnese, in considerable numbers. Secondly, Christian Albanians had fought with distinction and in considerable numbers in the War of Independence. Thirdly, credible Albanian claims for the establishment of an Albanian nation state materialized too Late for Greek national theorists to abandon well-entrenched positions. Commenting on a geography textbook for primary schools in 1901, a state committee found it inadequate and misleading. One of its principal shortcomings concerned the Albanians, who were described as ‘close kinsmen of the Greeks’. ‘These are unacceptable from the point of view of our national claims and as far as historical truth is concerned’, commented the committee. ‘it must have been maintained that they are of common descent with the Greeks (Pelasgians), that they speak a language akin to that of the Greeks and that they participated in all struggles for national liberation of the common fatherland.’"</ref> Arvanitika is in a state of attrition due to language shift towards Greek and large-scale internal migration to the cities and subsequent intermingling of the population during the 20th century.

The [[Cham Albanians]] were a group that formerly inhabited a region of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] known as [[Chameria]], nowadays [[Thesprotia]] in northwestern Greece. Most Cham Albanians converted to Islam during the Ottoman era. [[Islam|Muslim]] Chams were [[Expulsion of Cham Albanians|expelled]] from Greece during [[World War II]], by an [[EDES|anti-communist resistance group]], as a result of their participation in a [[EAM-ELAS|communist resistance group]] and the [[Axis-Cham Albanian collaboration|collaboration]] with the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]], while Orthodox Chams have largely assimilated into the Greek nation.

After the breakdown of the communist regime in Albania in 1990, Italy had been the main immigration target for Albanians leaving their country.

There are small Albanian populations dating to migrations from the 18th century. One group known as the ''[[Arbanas]]'' are located on Croatia's Dalmatian coast and fled Ottoman repression.<ref name="Barancic551"/> The second known as the ''Албанці'' (Albantsi) are located in scattered communities across southern Ukraine and descend from Albanian warriors who fought against the Ottoman Empire during the [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|Russo-Turkish wars]] and allowed to settle in the [[Russian Empire]].<ref name="Novik261262"/> The actual number of the Albanian population in Romania is unofficially estimated at around 10,000 persons.

Approximately 1 million are dispersed throughout the rest of Europe. These are mainly refugees from Kosovo that migrated during the Kosovo war. During the Kosovo war in 1999, many Kosovo Albanians sought asylum in the Federal Republic of Germany. By the end of 1999, the number of Kosovo Albanians in Germany was about 480,000, about 100,000 had returned voluntarily after the war in their homeland or been forcibly removed. The cities with the largest population of Germans of Albanian descent are the metropolitan regions of [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]] and [[Stuttgart]]. In Berlin in 1999, there were about 25,000 Albanians; the number dropped because of remigration and Germany's general population decline. In Sweden, Albanians number approximately 54,000. As of 2011 there are approximately 100,000 Albanians living in the United Kingdom.

The Albanian diaspora in Turkey was formed during the Ottoman era through economic migration and early years of the Turkish republic through migration due to sociopolitical discrimination and violence experienced by Albanians in Balkan countries.<ref name="GenisMaynard553555">{{harvnb|Geniş|Maynard|2009|pp=553–555}}. "Taking a chronological perspective, the ethnic Albanians currently living in Turkey today could be categorized into three groups: Ottoman Albanians, Balkan Albanians, and twentieth century Albanians. The first category comprises descendants of Albanians who relocated to the Marmara and Aegean regions as part of the Ottoman Empire's administrative structure. Official Ottoman documents record the existence of Albanians living in and around Istanbul (Constantinople), Iznik (Nicaea), and Izmir (Smyrna). For example, between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries Albanian boys were brought to Istanbul and housed in Topkapı Palace as part of the ''devşirme'' system (an early Ottoman practice of human tribute required of Christian citizens) to serve as civil servants and Janissaries. In the 1600s Albanian seasonal workers were employed by these Albanian Janissaries in and around Istanbul and Iznik, and in 1860 Kayserili Ahmet, the governor of Izmir, employed Albanians to fight the raiding Zeybeks. Today, the descendants of Ottoman Albanians do not form a community per se, but at least some still identify as ethnically Albanian. However, it is unknown how many, if any, of these Ottoman Albanians retain Albanian language skills. The second category of ethnic Albanians living in modern Turkey is composed of people who are the descendants of refugees from the Balkans who because of war were forced to migrate inwards towards Eastern Thrace and Anatolia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as the Ottoman Empire dissolved. These Balkan Albanians are the largest group of ethnic Albanians living in Turkey today, and can be subcategorized into those who ended up in actual Albanian-speaking communities and those who were relocated into villages where they were the only Albanian-speaking migrants. Not surprisingly, the language is retained by some of the descendants from those of the former, but not those of the latter. The third category of ethnic Albanians in Turkey comprises recent or twentieth century migrants from the Balkans. These recent migrants can be subcategorized into those who came from Kosovo in the 1950s–1970s, those who came from Kosovo in 1999, and those who came from the Republic of Albania after 1992. All of these in the third category know a variety of modern Albanian and are mostly located in the western parts of Turkey in large metropolitan areas. Our research focuses on the history of migration and community formation of the Albanians located in the Samsun Province in the Black Sea region around 1912–1913 who would fall into the second category discussed above (see Figure 1). Turkish census data between 1927 and 1965 recorded the presence of Albanian speakers in Samsun Province, and the fieldwork we have been conducting in Samsun since September 2005 has revealed that there is still a significant number of Albanians living in the city and its surrounding region. According to the community leaders we interviewed, there are about 30,000–40,000 ethnic Albanian Turkish citizens in Samsun Province. The community was largely rural, located in the villages and engaged in agricultural activities until the 1970s. After this time, gradual migration to urban areas, particularly smaller towns and nearby cities has been observed. Long-distance rural-to-urban migration also began in later years mostly due to increasing demand for education and better jobs. Those who migrated to areas outside of Samsun Province generally preferred the cities located in the west of Turkey, particularly metropolitan areas such as Istanbul, Izmir and Bursa mainly because of the job opportunities as well as the large Albanian communities already residing in these cities. Today, the size of the Albanian community in Samsun Province is considered to be much smaller and gradually shrinking because of outward migration. Our observation is that the Albanians in Samsun seem to be fully integrated into Turkish society, and engaged in agriculture and small trading businesses. As education becomes accessible to the wider society and modernization accelerates transportation and hence communication of urban values, younger generations have also started to acquire professional occupations. Whilst a significant number of people still speak Albanian fluently as the language in the family, they have a perfect command of the Turkish language and cannot be distinguished from the rest of the population in terms of occupation, education, dress and traditions. In this article, we are interested in the history of this Albanian community in Samsun. Given the lack of any research on the Albanian presence in Turkey, our questions are simple and exploratory. When and where did these people come from? How and why did they choose Samsun as a site of resettlement? How did the socio- cultural characteristics of this community change over time? It is generally believed that the Albanians in Samsun Province are the descendants of the migrants and refugees from Kosovo who arrived in Turkey during the wars of 1912–13. Based on our research in Samsun Province, we argue that this information is partial and misleading. The interviews we conducted with the Albanian families and community leaders in the region and the review of Ottoman history show that part of the Albanian community in Samsun was founded through three stages of successive migrations. The first migration involved the forced removal of Muslim Albanians from the Sancak of Nish in 1878; the second migration occurred when these migrants’ children fled from the massacres in Kosovo in 1912–13 to Anatolia; and the third migration took place between 1913 and 1924 from the scattered villages in Central Anatolia where they were originally placed to the Samsun area in the Black Sea Region. Thus, the Albanian community founded in the 1920s in Samsun was in many ways a reassembling of the demolished Muslim Albanian community of Nish. This trajectory of the Albanian community of Nish shows that the fate of this community was intimately bound up with the fate of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans and the socio-cultural composition of modern Turkey still carries on the legacy of its historical ancestor."</ref> According to a 2008 report prepared for the [[National Security Council (Turkey)|National Security Council]] of Turkey by academics of three Turkish universities in eastern [[Anatolia]], there were approximately 1,300,000 people of Albanian descent living in Turkey.<ref>Milliyet, Türkiyedeki Kürtlerin Sayısı. 2008-06-06.</ref> According to that study, more than 500,000 Albanian descendants still recognize their ancestry and or their language, culture and traditions.<ref name="Zamanheritage">"[http://www.todayszaman.com/national_albanians-in-turkey-celebrate-their-cultural-heritage_254383.html Albanians in Turkey celebrate their cultural heritage] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031102644/http://www.todayszaman.com/national_albanians-in-turkey-celebrate-their-cultural-heritage_254383.html |date=31 October 2015 }}".

{{Main article|Albanian language}}
The [[Albanian language]] forms a separate branch of the [[Indo-European]] languages family tree. A traditional view, based mainly on the territory where the languages were spoken, links the origin of [[Albanian language|Albanian]] with [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]]. Not enough Illyrian archaeological evidence is left behind however, to come to a definite conclusion. Another theory links the Albanian as originating from the [[Thracian language]]: however this theory takes exception to the territory, since the Thracian language was spoken in an area distinct from Albania, and no significant population movements have been recorded in the period when the shift from one language to the other is supposed to have occurred.<ref name="Hock54">{{harvnb|Hock|Joseph|1996|p=54}}.</ref>

Albanian in a revised form of the [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] dialect is the [[official language]] of [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]];{{efn|name=status}} and it is the official language in the municipalities where there are more than 20% ethnic Albanian inhabitants in the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. It is also an official language of [[Montenegro]] where it is spoken in the municipalities with ethnic Albanian populations.

During the 20th century the monarchy and later the [[totalitarian state]] followed a systematic secularization of the nation and the national culture. This policy was chiefly applied within the borders of the current Albanian state. It produced a secular majority in the population. All forms of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and other religious practices were prohibited except for old non-institutional [[pagan]] practices in the rural areas, which were seen as identifying with the national culture. The current Albanian state has revived some pagan festivals, such as the [[Spring Day|Spring]] festival ({{lang-sq|Dita e Verës}}) held yearly on 14 March in the city of [[Elbasan]]. It is a national holiday.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[Music of Albania|Albanian folk music]]  displays a variety of influences. Albanian folk music traditions differ by region, with major stylistic differences between the traditional music of the [[Ghegs]] in the north and [[Tosks]] in the south. Modern popular music has developed around the centers of [[Korca]], [[Shkodër]] and [[Tirana]]. Since the 1920s, some composers such as [[Fan S. Noli]] have also produced works of Albanian [[classical music]].
