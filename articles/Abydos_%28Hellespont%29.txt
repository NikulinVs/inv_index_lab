'''Abydos''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄβῡδος}}) or '''Abydus''', an ancient city at [[Troad]] (Troas), in [[Asia Minor]] was located  on the western slope of the promontory south of Nağara Point, and is sited on the best harbor on the Asiatic shore of the [[Hellespont]]. The acropolis of Abydos stood on the hill of Mal Tepe. [[Sestus]] lies north across from Abydos, on the European side of one of the narrowest points of the [[Dardanelles]], slightly more than a nautical mile ({{convert|1|nmi|disp=out}}) broad; the narrowest point is at [[Çanakkale]]. The site is enclosed in a military zone considered to be of strategic importance, and access to it throughout the 20th century was generally prohibited. 

Abydos was first mentioned in the catalogue of Trojan allies.<ref>''[[Iliad]]'' ii.836</ref>  [[Strabo]], noting that earlier the area was Thracian, states that the city itself was founded by [[Miletus|Milesian colonists]] with the consent of [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges, king of Lydia]],<ref>[[Strabo]]. ''[[Geographica]]'', Bk.1:1.22.</ref> around 700&nbsp;BC. It was occupied by the Persians in 514&nbsp;BC, and [[Darius the Great]] burnt it in 512&nbsp;BC. Here [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] built [[Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges |two pontoon bridges]] and crossed the strait in 480&nbsp;BC, when he [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|invaded Greece]].<ref>[[Herodotus]].  ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', 7.34.</ref> It later was a member of the [[Delian League]].

Abydos is celebrated for the vigorous resistance it made against [[Philip V of Macedon]] in 200&nbsp;BC.<ref>[[Polybius]].  ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/16*.html 16.29-34]</ref> In literature, it is famous for the mythical home of [[Hero and Leander|Leander]]. Lord [[Byron]] memorably adopted its name in his ''[[The Bride of Abydos]]''.<ref>{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Abydos}}</ref> It minted coins from the early 5th century BC to the mid-3rd century AD.

The town remained until late Byzantine times as an important toll and customs station of the Hellespont, its importance thereafter being transferred to the [[Dardanelles]], after the building of the "Old Castles" by Sultan [[Mehmet II]] (c. 1456).<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Abydos (Mysia) |display=Abydos|volume=1|page=81}}</ref>

== Bishopric ==

The [[bishopric]] of Abydus in the [[Roman province]] of [[Hellespontus]] appears in all the ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] from the mid-7th century until the time of [[Andronicus III]] (1341), first as a [[suffragan]] of [[Cyzicus]] and then from 1084 as a [[metropolitan see]] without suffragans. The earliest bishop mentioned in extant documents is Marcianus, who signed the joint letter of the bishops of Hellespontus to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo I the Thracian]] in 458, protesting about the murder of [[Proterius of Alexandria]]. A letter of [[Peter the Fuller]] (471–488) mentions a bishop of Abydus called Pamphilus. Ammonius signed the decretal letter of the Council of Constantinople in 518 against [[Severus of Antioch]] and others. Isidorus was at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] (680–681), Ioannes at the [[Trullan Council]] (692), Theodorus at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787). An unnamed bishop of Abydus was a counsellor of Emperor [[Nicephorus II]] in 969.<ref>Michel Lequien.
