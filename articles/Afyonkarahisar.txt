==Etymology==
The name '''Afyon Kara Hisar''' (literally ''opium black castle'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), since [[opium]] was widely grown here and there is a castle on a black rock.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Also known simply as '''Afyon'''. Older spellings include '''Karahisar-i Sahip''', '''Afium-Kara-hissar''' and '''Afyon Karahisar'''.  The city was known as Afyon (opium), until the name was changed to Afyonkarahisar by the [[Turkish Parliament]] in 2004.

==History==
[[File:15th century map of Turkey region.jpg|thumb|Photo of a 15th-century map showing region containing Nicopolis.]]

The top of the rock in Afyon has been fortified for a long time. It was known to the [[Hittites]] as '''Hapanuwa''', and was later occupied by [[Phrygians]], [[Lydians]] and [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persians]] until it was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. After the death of Alexander the city (now known as  '''Akroinοn''' (Ακροϊνόν) or '''Nikopolis''' (Νικόπολις) in [[Ancient Greek]]), was ruled by the [[Seleucids]] and the kings of [[Pergamon]], then [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. The [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] after his [[Battle of Akroinon|victory]] over [[Arab]] besiegers in 740 renamed the city '''Nicopolis''' (Greek for "city of victory"). The [[Seljuq Turks]] then arrived in 1071 and changed its name to '''Kara Hissar''' ("black castle") after the ancient fortress situated upon a volcanic rock 201&nbsp;meters above the town. Following the dispersal of the Seljuqs the town was occupied by the [[Sâhib Ata]] and then the [[Germiyanids]].

The castle was much fought over during the [[Crusades]] and was finally conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Beyazid I]] in 1392 but was lost after the invasion of [[Timur Lenk]] in 1402. It was recaptured in 1428 or 1429.

The area thrived during the Ottoman Empire, as the centre of opium production and Afyon became a wealthy city. During the 1st World War British prisoners of war who had been captured at Gallipoli were housed here in an empty Armenian church at the foot of the rock. During the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] campaign (part of the [[Turkish War of Independence]])  Afyon and the surrounding hills were occupied by Greek forces. However, it was recovered on 27 August 1922, a key moment in the Turkish counter-attack in the Aegean region. After 1923 Afyon became a part of the Republic of Turkey.

The region was a major producer of raw opium (hence the name ''Afyon'') until the late 1960s when under international pressure, from the USA in particular, the fields were burnt and production ceased.  Now poppies are grown under a strict licensing regime.  They do not produce raw opium any more but derive Morphine and other opiates using the poppy straw method of extraction.<ref>https://fco-stage.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/pdf20/fco_adidu_licitcultivation{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Afyon was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 50 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknote of 1927-1938.<ref>[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey].

==Economy==
The economy of Afyonkarahisar is based on agriculture, industries and thermal tourism. 
Especially its agriculture is strongly developed from the fact, a large part of its population living in the countrysides. Which stimulated agricultural activities greatly.

===Marble===
Afyonkarahisar produces an important chunk of Turkish processed marbles, it ranks second on processed marble exports and fourth on travertine.<ref>{{cite book|author=Belkıs ÖZKAR |title= mermer sektöründe katma degerin ve ihracatin artirilmasi|url=http://www.zafer.org.tr/jdownloads/Raporlar%20%20Strateji%20Belgeleri/mermer-sektorunde-katma-degerin-ve-ihracatin-artirilmasi.pdf|page=29}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Dilsad Erkek |title=Mermer ve Traverten Sektörüne Küresel ve Bölgesel Yaklaşım |url=http://geka.gov.tr/Dosyalar/o_19v5e0ki7134g6no139s7pj10658.pdf|page=25}}</ref> Afyon holds an important share of Turkish marble reserves, with some 12,2% of total Turkish reserves.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sevgi Gürcan|title=Türkiye ve Afyon'da mermer sektörünün gelisim trendi, Kocatepe University|url=http://www.maden.org.tr/resimler/ekler/24d21019de5e59d_ek.pdf|page=389}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Nuran Tasligil|title=Die Analyse der als Baumaterial genutzten, Marmara University|url=http://e-dergi.marmara.edu.tr/marucog/article/viewFile/5000172507/5000155571|page=619}}</ref>

Afyon has unique marble types and colors, which were historically very renown and are unique to Afyon. Like "Afyon white", historically known as "Synnadic white". "Afyon Menekse", historically known as "Pavonazzetto"<ref>{{cite book|author=Barbara E. Borg|title=A Companion to Roman Art|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=DS-PCgAAQBAJ&dq=bath-gymnasium+pavonazzetto&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|page=157|year=2015}}</ref> and "Afyon kaplan postu", this type wasn't popular.
Historically marble from Afyon was generally referred to as "Docimeaen marble".<ref name="Strabo">{{cite book|author=Strabo|title=Geography|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D16}} "Book 9, chapter 5, section 16"</ref>
Docimian marble was highly admired and valued for its unique colors and fine grained quality, by ancients such as Romans.<ref>{{cite book|author=Donato Attanasio |title=Ancient White Marbles|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=08gOUB2qRcQC&dq=docimian+marble+church&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|page=154|year=2003 }}</ref> When the Romans took control over Docimian quarries, they were blown away about the beautiful color combinations of Docimian Pavonazzetto, which is a type of white marble with purple veins. A trend started about it right away. Emperor's Augustus, Trajan, Hadrian, all made extensive use of Docimian marble to all their major building projects.<ref>{{cite book|author=Donato Attanasio |title=Ancient White Marbles |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=08gOUB2qRcQC&dq=ancient+white+marbles&source=gbs_navlinks_s|page=157|year=2003 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Strabo|title=Geography|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D12%3Achapter%3D8%3Asection%3D14}} Book 12, 8, 14</ref>

Docimian Pavonazzetto was extensively used in major building projects in the very heart of Rome aka Forum Romanum and all over the empire. Pavonazzetto was used on the most eye catching places such as, columns, wall and floor veneer and wall reliefs. Other marbles from all corners of the empire were used in combination, whenever Pavonazzetto was used as floor cover, it was usually in combination with other decorative marbles. But, the Pavonazzetto being a white marble was mostly the dominant color and gave the buildings a freshening white color.    
[[File:Pantheon11111.jpg|thumb|right|Pantheon, Rome. White Docimian marble is used on the floor and some of the columns such as the two protruding columns of the main apse. The white Docimian color on the floor is very dominant]]

As a result, one of the greatest masterpieces were made from this material. Such as sarcophagus of, Sidamara, Silifkeh, Seleukeia, Eudocia, Heraclius....several hundreds sarcophagi were constructed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Donato Attanasio |author2=Mauro Brilli|title=The Isotopic Signature of Classical Marbles|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=-ihbTxFE2RkC&dq=studia+archaeologica&source=gbs_navlinks_s|page=151|year=2006}}</ref>

===Thermal sector===
The geography of Afyon has great geothermal activity. Hence, the place has plenty thermal springs, there are about 5 main springs. Each of them have high mineral contents and high degree's, 40&nbsp;°C-100&nbsp;°C. The waters have strong healing properties to some diseases.
As a result, plenty of thermals commenced over time.

In time Afyon has developed it's thermal sector with more capacity, comfort and innovation. Afyon combined the traditional bath houses with 5 star resorts, the health benefits of the natural springs have put the thermal resorts further then a mere attraction.
Hospitals and universities have come in association with thermal resorts, to utilize the full health potentials of the thermals. 
As such, Kocatepe University Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Hospital opened for that purpose.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kurtulus Karamustafa |author2=ömer Sanlioglu |author3=Kenan Gülle |title=Ulusal Turizm Kongresi, Erciyes University|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=ZUgsCQAAQBAJ&dq=afyon+termalin+baskenti&source=gbs_navlinks_s|pages=245–246|year=2013}}</ref>

===Spa water===
Kizilay, was the first mineral water factory in Turkey which opened in Afyon, in 1926 by Atatürk. After the mineral water from Gazligöl springs, healed Ataturks kidneys and proved its health benefits. Since its foundation, "Kizilay Spa Water" grew as the biggest spa water distributor in Turkey, Middle-East and Balkans.<ref>[http://www.yenisafak.com/ekonomi/kizilay-maden-suyu-17-ulkeye-satiliyor-2226071 Yeni Safak]</ref><ref>[http://www.kizilaymadensuyu.com.tr/assets/pdf/katalog.pdf Kizilay]</ref>

===Pharmaceuticals and morphine===
Almost a third of all the morphine produced in the world derives from alkaloids factory in Afyon, named as "Afyon Alkaloids". this large capacity is the byproduct of Afyon's poppy plantations. The pharmaceuticals derive from the opium of the poppy capsules. 
"Afyon Alkaloids" factory is the largest of its kind in the world,<ref>{{cite book|author=US Department for State Bureau|title=International Narcotics Control Strategy Report|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=w0DlWjK3YCEC&dq=bolvadin+alkaloid+factory&source=gbs_navlinks_s|page=388}}</ref><ref>[http://www.tmo.gov.tr/Upload/Document/poppy.pdf plantation Office] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007054501/http://www.tmo.gov.tr/Upload/Document/poppy.pdf |date=October 7, 2013 }}</ref> with high capacity processing ability and modern laboratories. The raw opium is put through a chain of biochemical processes, resulting into several types of morphine.

In the Alkaloid Extraction Unit only base morphine is produced. In the adjacent Derivatives Unit half of the morphine extracted is converted to morphine hydrochloride, codeine, codeine phosphate, codeine sulphate, codeine hydrochloride, morphine sulphate, ethylmorphine hydrochloride.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zohara Yaniv |author2=Nativ Dudai |others=Institute of Plant Sciences|title=Medical and Aromatic Plants of the Middle-East|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=HuSCBAAAQBAJ&dq=Medicinal+and+Aromatic&source=gbs_navlinks_s|page=328|year=2014}}</ref>

===Agriculture===

'''Livestocks'''
Afyon breeds a large amount of livestocks, its landscape and demography is suitable for this field. As such it ranks in the top 10 within Turkey in terms of amounts of sheep and cattle it has.<ref>[http://www.tuik.gov.tr/PreHaberBultenleri.do?id=18852 Government of Turkey, statistics]</ref>

==Afyon today==
Afyon is the centre of an agricultural area and the city has a country town feel to it. There is little in the way of bars, cafes, live music or other cultural amenities, and the standards of education are low for a city in the west of Turkey. However [[Afyon Kocatepe University]] opened in the 1990s and this must surely lead to improvements eventually.
Nowadays Afyon is known for its [[marble]] (in 2005 there were 355 marble quarries in the province of Afyon producing high quality white stone), its ''[[sucuk]]'' (spiced sausages), its ''[[kaymak]]'' (meaning either ''cream'' or a white [[Turkish Delight]]) and various handmade weavings. There is also a large cement factory.

This is a natural crossroads, the routes from [[Ankara]] to [[İzmir]] and from [[Istanbul]] to [[Antalya]] intersect here and Afyon is a popular stopping-place on these journeys. There are a number of well-established roadside restaurants for travellers to breakfast on the local cuisine. Some of these places are modern well-equipped hotels and spas; the mineral waters of Afyon are renowned for their healing qualities. There is also a long string of roadside kiosks selling the local Turkish delight.

===Transport===
Afyon is also an important rail junction between İzmir, [[Konya]], Ankara and Istanbul. Afyon is on the route of the planned high-speed rail line between Ankara and Izmir.
