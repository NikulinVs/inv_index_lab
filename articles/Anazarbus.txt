'''Anazarbus ''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀναζαρβός}}, medieval '''Ain Zarba'''; modern '''Anavarza''') was an ancient [[Cilicia]]n city and (arch)bishopric,<ref>Oriens christianus: in quatuor patriarchatus digestus : quo exhibentur ...
By Michel Le Quien ((O.P.)), Oriens christianus (ex Typographia Regia, 1740) [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=0agp0mJFG_sC&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Anazarbus&f=false   p40].</ref> which remains a Latin Catholic [[Titular See]].<ref>''[[Annuario Pontificio]] 2013'' ([[Libreria Editrice Vaticana]] 2013 ISBN 978-88-209-9070-1).</ref>

== Location ==
It was situated in [[Anatolia]] in modern [[Turkey]], in the present [[Çukurova]] (or classical [[Aleian plain]]) about 15&nbsp;km west of the main stream of the present [[Ceyhan River]] (or classical [[Pyramus river]]) and near its tributary the [[Sempas Su]].

A lofty isolated ridge formed its [[acropolis]]. Though some of the masonry in the ruins is certainly pre-Roman, the [[Suda]]'s identification of it with [[Cyinda]], famous as a treasure city in the wars of [[Eumenes of Cardia]], cannot be accepted in the face of [[Strabo]]'s express location of Cyinda in western Cilicia.

== History ==
It was founded by [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. Under the early [[Roman empire]] the place was known as '''Caesarea''', and was the Metropolis (capital) of Late [[Roman province]] [[Cilicia Secunda]]. It was the home of the poet [[Oppian]].
 
Rebuilt by the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Justin I]] after an [[earthquake]] in the 6th century, it became '''Justinopolis''' (525); but the old native name persisted, and when [[Thoros I of Armenia|Thoros I]], king of [[Lesser Armenia]], made it his capital early in the 12th century, it was known as '''Anazarva'''.

== Remains ==
Its great natural strength and situation, not far from the mouth of the Sis pass, and near the great road which [[debouches|debouched]] from the [[Cilician Gates]], made Anazarbus play a considerable part in the struggles between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the early [[Muslim]] invaders. It had been rebuilt by [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 796, refortified at great expense by the [[Hamdanid]] [[Sayf al-Dawla]] (mid-10th century) and again destroyed in 962 by [[Nikephoros II Phokas]].

In late 1097 or early 1098 it was captured by the armies of the [[First Crusade]] and was incorporated into Bohemond’s Principality of Antioch.  The Crusaders are probably responsible for the construction of an impressive donjon atop the center of the outcrop.  Most of the remaining fortifications, including the curtain walls, massive horse-shaped towers, undercrofts, cisterns, and free-standing structures date from the Armenian periods of occupation, which began with the arrival of the [[Thoros I, Prince of Armenia|Rubenid Baron T‛oros I]], ca. 1111.<ref name="edwards">{{cite book| last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=The Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: Dumbarton Oaks Studies XXIII |date=1987 |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University| location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-88402-163-7|pages=65–72, 281, pls.9a-18b, 287b-289c}}</ref>  The site briefly exchanged hands between the Greeks and Armenians, until it was formally part of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].  Within the fortress are two Armenian chapels and the magnificent (but severely damaged) three-aisle church built by T‛oros I to celebrate his conquests.<ref>Robert W. Edwards, “Ecclesiastical Architecture in the Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: First Report, ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' 36, 1982, pp.156-61, 168, pls.1-7.</ref><ref>Robert W. Edwards, “Ecclesiastical Architecture in the Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: Second Report, ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' 37, 1983, pp.128-34, pls.2, 18-29, 36-46.</ref>  The church was once surrounded by a continuous, well-executed dedicatory inscription in Armenian.

The [[Mamluk]] Empire of Egypt finally destroyed the city in 1374.

The present wall of the lower city is of late construction. It encloses a mass of ruins conspicuous in which are a fine [[triumphal arch]], the colonnades of two streets, a [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], etc. A stadium and a theatre lie outside the walls to the south. The remains of the acropolis fortifications are very interesting, including roads and ditches hewn in the rock. There are no notable structures in the upper town. For picturesqueness the site is not equaled in Cilicia, and it is worthwhile to trace the three fine [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s to their sources.  A necropolis on the escarpment to the south of the curtain wall can also be seen complete with signs of illegal modern excavations.

A visit in December 2002 showed that the three aqueducts mentioned above have been nearly completely destroyed. Only small, isolated sections are left standing with the largest portion lying in a pile of rubble that stretches the length of where the aqueducts once stood. A powerful earthquake that struck the area in 1945 is thought to be responsible for the destruction.

A modest Turkish farming village ([[Dilekkaya, Kozan|Dilekkaya]]) lies to the southwest of the ancient city. A small outdoor museum with some of the artifacts collected in the area can be viewed for a small fee. Also nearby are some beautiful mosaics discovered in a farmers field.  Inquire at the museum for a viewing.

Anazarbus/Anavarsa was one of a chain of Armenian fortifications stretching through Cilicia.  The [[Sis (ancient city)|castle of Sis]] (modern [[Kozan, Adana]]) lies to the north while Tumlu Castle and [[Yilankale]] are to the south, and the fortresses of [[Amouda]] and [[Sarvandikar]] are to the east.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Anazarbus was the capital and so also from 553 (the date of the [[Second Council of Constantinople]]) the [[metropolitan see]] of the Late [[Roman province]] of [[Cilicia Secunda]].

A [[6th century]] ''[[Notitia Episcopatuum]]'' indicates that it had as [[suffragan]] sees [[Epiphania, Cilicia|Epiphania]], [[Alexandria Minor]], [[Irenopolis, Cilicia|Irenopolis]], [[Flavias]], [[Castabala (city)|Castabala]] and [[Aegeae (Turkey)|Aegeae]]. [[Arsuz|Rhosus]] was also subject to Anazarbus, but after the 6th century was made exempt, and [[Mopsuestia]] was raised to the rank of [[autcephalous metropolitan]] see, though without suffragans.<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 885-888</ref><ref>Gaetano Moroni, ''Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=I7QAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA40 Vol. 2], pp.&nbsp;40–41</ref><ref>Siméon Vailhé, v.
