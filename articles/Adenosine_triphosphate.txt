'''Adenosine triphosphate''' ('''ATP''') is a [[nucleoside triphosphate]] (NTP) a small molecule used in [[cell (biology)|cells]] as a [[coenzyme]]. It is often referred to as the "[[molecule|molecular]] unit of [[currency]]" of intracellular [[energy transfer]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knowles |first=J.&nbsp;R. |title=Enzyme-catalyzed phosphoryl transfer reactions |journal=Annu.

ATP transports chemical energy within [[cell (biology)|cells]] for [[metabolism]]. Most cellular functions need energy in order to be carried out: synthesis of proteins, synthesis of membranes, movement of the cell, cellular division, etc. need energy to be performed. The ATP is the molecule that carries energy to the place where the energy is needed. When ATP breaks into [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] (Adenosine diphosphate) and [[phosphate|P<sub>i</sub>]] (phosphate), the breakdown of the last covalent link of phosphate (a simple -P04) liberates energy that is used in reactions where it is needed.

It is one of the end products of [[photophosphorylation]], [[aerobic respiration]], and [[fermentation]], and is used by [[enzyme]]s and [[Cytoskeleton|structural proteins]] in many cellular processes, including [[biosynthesis|biosynthetic reactions]], [[Motor protein|motility]], and [[cell division]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Campbell | first = Neil A. |first2= Brad|last2= Williamson|first3= Robin J.|last3= Heyden | title = Biology: Exploring Life | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2006 | location = Boston, MA | url = http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html | isbn = 0-13-250882-6 }}</ref> One molecule of ATP contains [[adenine]], [[ribose]], and three [[phosphate]] groups, and it is produced by a wide variety of enzymes, including [[ATP synthase]], from [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) or [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP) and various phosphate group donors.

ATP is used as a [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] in [[signal transduction]] pathways by [[kinase]]s that [[phosphorylation|phosphorylate]] [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s. It is also used by [[adenylate cyclase]], which uses ATP to produce the [[second messenger]] molecule [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cyclic AMP]].

The structure of this molecule consists of a [[purine]] base ([[adenine]]) attached by the 9′ nitrogen atom to the 1′ carbon atom of a [[pentose]] sugar ([[ribose]]). Three phosphate groups are attached at the 5′ carbon atom of the pentose sugar. It is the addition and removal of these phosphate groups that inter-convert ATP, [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and AMP. When ATP is used in DNA synthesis, the ribose sugar is first converted to [[deoxyribose]] by [[ribonucleotide reductase]].

==Physical and chemical properties==
ATP consists of [[adenosine]]&nbsp;– composed of an [[adenine]] ring and a [[ribose]] sugar&nbsp;– and three [[phosphate]] groups (triphosphate). The phosphoryl groups, starting with the group closest to the ribose, are referred to as the alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) phosphates. Consequently, it is closely related to the adenosine nucleotide, a [[monomer]] of [[RNA]]. ATP is highly soluble in water and is quite stable in solutions between pH&nbsp;6.8 and 7.4, but is rapidly [[hydrolysis|hydrolysed]] at extreme pH. Consequently, ATP is best stored as an anhydrous salt.<ref>{{Merck13th}}</ref>

ATP is an unstable molecule in [[Buffer solution|unbuffered]] water, in which it [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyses]] to [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and phosphate. This is because the strength of the bonds between the phosphate groups in ATP is less than the strength of the [[hydrogen bond]]s (hydration bonds), between its products (ADP and phosphate), and water. Thus, if ATP and ADP are in [[chemical equilibrium]] in water, almost all of the ATP will eventually be converted to ADP. A system that is far from equilibrium contains [[Gibbs free energy]], and is capable of doing [[work (thermodynamics)|work]]. Living cells maintain the ratio of ATP to ADP at a point ten orders of magnitude from equilibrium, with ATP concentrations fivefold higher than the concentration of ADP. This displacement from equilibrium means that the hydrolysis of ATP in the cell releases a large amount of free energy.<ref name=Nicholls>{{cite book |last1=Ferguson |first1=S.&nbsp;J. |last2=Nicholls |first2=David |last3=Ferguson |first3=Stuart |title=Bioenergetics 3 |publisher=Academic |location=San Diego, CA |year=2002 |isbn=0-12-518121-3 |edition=3rd}}</ref>

Two [[phosphoanhydride]] bonds (those that connect adjacent phosphates) in an ATP molecule are responsible for the high energy content of this molecule.<ref name="Stryer p376">{{cite book |first1=J.&nbsp;M. |last1=Berg |first2=J.&nbsp; L. |last2=Tymoczko |first3=L. |last3=Stryer | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.&nbsp;H. Freeman | year = 2003 | location = New York, NY | page = 376 |isbn = 0-7167-4684-0}}</ref> In the context of biochemical reactions, these anhydride bonds are frequently&nbsp;– and sometimes controversially&nbsp;– referred to as [[high-energy phosphate|''high-energy bonds'']] (despite the fact it takes energy to break bonds).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chance|first1= B. |last2=Lees|first2= H. |last3=Postgate|first3= J.&nbsp;G. | title = The Meaning of "Reversed Electron Flow" and "High Energy Electron" in Biochemistry|doi=10.1038/238330a0|journal = Nature | volume = 238 | pages = 330–331 | year = 1972 | pmid = 4561837 | issue = 5363 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v238/n5363/abs/238330a0.html}}</ref> Energy stored in ATP may be released upon [[hydrolysis]] of the anhydride bonds.<ref name="Stryer p376"/> The primary phosphate group on the ATP molecule that is hydrolyzed when energy is needed to drive anabolic reactions is the γ-phosphate group. Located the farthest from the ribose sugar, it has a higher energy of hydrolysis than either the α- or β-phosphate. The bonds formed after hydrolysis&nbsp;– or the phosphorylation of a residue by ATP&nbsp;– are lower in energy than the phosphoanhydride bonds of ATP. During enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP or phosphorylation by ATP, the available free energy can be harnessed by a living system to do work.<ref>{{cite book | last = Koolman | first = J. |first2= K.&nbsp;H. |last2=Roehm | title = Color Atlas of Biochemistry | publisher = Georg Thieme Verlag | location = Stuttgart | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hjrcWquBnusC&pg=PA123|year=2005 | isbn = 3-13-100372-3 | page=123}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = Oxford Dictionary of Chemistry | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | location = Oxford | page = 435 | isbn = 0-19-860918-3 | editor = John Daintith }}</ref>

Any unstable system of potentially reactive molecules could potentially serve as a way of storing free energy, if the cell maintained their concentration far from the equilibrium point of the reaction.<ref name=Nicholls/> However, as is the case with most polymeric biomolecules, the breakdown of RNA, DNA, and ATP into simpler monomers is driven by both energy-release and entropy-increase considerations, in both standard concentrations, and also those concentrations encountered within the cell.

The standard amount of energy released from hydrolysis of ATP can be calculated from the changes in energy under non-natural (standard) conditions, then correcting to biological concentrations. The net change in heat energy ([[enthalpy]]) at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] of the decomposition of ATP into hydrated ADP and hydrated inorganic phosphate is −30.5&nbsp;[[joule per mole|kJ/mol]], with a change in [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of 3.4&nbsp;kJ/mol.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gajewski |first1=E. |last2=Steckler |first2=D. |last3=Goldberg |first3=R. | title = Thermodynamics of the hydrolysis of adenosine 5′-triphosphate to adenosine 5′-diphosphate | url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/261/27/12733.pdf |format=PDF| journal = J.

These values can be used to calculate the change in energy under physiological conditions and the cellular ATP/ADP ratio. However, a more representative value (which takes AMP into consideration) called the [[Energy charge]] is increasingly being employed. The values given for the [[Gibbs free energy]] for this reaction are dependent on a number of factors, including overall ionic strength and the presence of [[alkaline earth metal]] ions such as [[magnesium|{{chem|Mg|2+}}]] and [[calcium|{{chem|Ca|2+}}]].

===Glycolysis===
{{Main|Glycolysis}}

In glycolysis, glucose and glycerol are metabolized to [[pyruvate]] via the glycolytic pathway. In most organisms, this process occurs in the [[cytosol]], but, in some protozoa such as the [[Kinetoplastida|kinetoplastid]]s, this is carried out in a specialized [[organelle]] called the [[glycosome]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Parsons | first = M. | title = Glycosomes: parasites and the divergence of peroxisomal purpose | journal = Mol.

Two molecules of [[NADH]] are also produced, which can be oxidized via the [[electron transport chain]] and result in the generation of additional ATP by [[ATP synthase]]. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the [[citric acid cycle|Krebs Cycle]].<ref name=Voet>{{cite book |last1=Voet |first1=D. |last2=Voet |first2=J.&nbsp;G. | year=2004 | title=Biochemistry |volume=1 |edition=3rd | publisher= Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ | isbn = 978-0-471-19350-0}}</ref>

===Glucose===
{{Main|Citric acid cycle|oxidative phosphorylation}}

In the [[mitochondrion]], pyruvate is oxidized by the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]] to the [[acetyl]] group, which is fully oxidized to [[carbon dioxide]] by the [[citric acid cycle]] (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every "turn" of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one molecule of the ATP equivalent [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP) through [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] catalyzed by [[succinyl-CoA synthetase]], three molecules of the reduced [[coenzyme]] [[NADH]], and one molecule of the reduced coenzyme [[Flavin group|FADH<sub>2</sub>]]. Both of these latter molecules are recycled to their oxidized states (NAD<sup>+</sup> and [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]], respectively) via the [[electron transport chain]], which generates additional ATP by [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. The oxidation of an NADH molecule results in the synthesis of 2–3 ATP molecules, and the oxidation of one FADH<sub>2</sub> yields between 1–2 ATP molecules.<ref name=Rich/> The majority of cellular ATP is generated by this process. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular [[oxygen]], it is an obligately [[aerobic glycolysis|aerobic]] process because O<sub>2</sub> is needed to recycle the reduced NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> to their oxidized states. In the absence of oxygen the citric acid cycle will cease to function due to the lack of available NAD<sup>+</sup> and FAD.<ref name=Lodish/>

The generation of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH relies on the [[malate-aspartate shuttle]] (and to a lesser extent, the [[glycerol-phosphate shuttle]]) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD<sup>+</sup>. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a [[malate dehydrogenase]] enzyme converts [[oxaloacetate]] to [[malate]], which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD<sup>+</sup>. A [[transaminase]] converts the oxaloacetate to [[aspartate]] for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.<ref name=Lodish/><!--will put the antiporter/full cycle in the shuttle article-->

In oxidative phosphorylation, the passage of electrons from NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> through the electron transport chain powers the pumping of [[proton]]s out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space. This creates a [[proton motive force]] that is the net effect of a [[pH]] gradient and an [[electric potential]] gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Flow of protons down this potential gradient&nbsp;– that is, from the intermembrane space to the matrix&nbsp;– provides the driving force for ATP synthesis by [[ATP synthase]].

Most of the ATP synthesized in the mitochondria will be used for cellular processes in the cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane contains an [[antiporter]], the [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]/ATP translocase, which is an [[integral membrane protein]] used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] in the intermembrane space.<ref name=Brandolin>{{cite journal |last1=Dahout-Gonzalez |first1=C. |last2=Nury |first2=H. |last3=Trézéguet |first3=V. |last4=Lauquin |first4=G. |last5=Pebay-Peyroula |first5=E. |last6=Brandolin |first6=G. | title = Molecular, functional, and pathological aspects of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier | journal = Physiology (Bethesda) | volume = 21 | pages = 242–249 | year = 2006| pmid = 16868313 | doi=10.1152/physiol.00005.2006 | url=http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/21/4/242 | issue = 4 }}</ref> This translocase is driven by the membrane potential, as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. However, it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate, partially dissipating the proton gradient.

===Beta oxidation===
{{Main|Beta-oxidation}}

Fatty acids can also be broken down to [[acetyl-CoA]] by [[beta-oxidation]]. Each round of this cycle reduces the length of the acyl chain by two carbon atoms and produces one NADH and one FADH<sub>2</sub> molecule, which are used to generate ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Because NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are energy-rich molecules, dozens of ATP molecules can be generated by the beta-oxidation of a single long acyl chain. The high energy yield of this process and the compact storage of fat explain why it is the most dense source of dietary [[calorie]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ronnett |first1=G. |last2=Kim |first2=E. |last3=Landree |first3=L. |last4=Tu |first4=Y. | title = Fatty acid metabolism as a target for obesity treatment | journal = Physiol.

===Fermentation===
{{Main|Fermentation (biochemistry)}}

[[fermentation (biochemistry)|Fermentation]] entails the generation of energy via the process of [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] in the absence of a respiratory [[electron transport chain]]. In most eukaryotes, glucose is used as both an energy store and an electron donor. The equation for the oxidation of glucose to [[lactic acid]] is:

: {{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}} → 2&nbsp;{{chem|CH|3|CH(OH)COOH}} + 2&nbsp;ATP

===Anaerobic respiration===
{{Main|Anaerobic respiration}}

Anaerobic respiration is the process of respiration using an [[electron acceptor]] other than {{chem|link=oxygen|O|2}}. In prokaryotes, multiple electron acceptors can be used in anaerobic respiration. These include [[nitrate]], [[sulfate]] or carbon dioxide. These processes lead to the ecologically important processes of [[denitrification]], sulfate reduction and [[acetogenesis]], respectively.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Zumft | first = W. | title = Cell biology and molecular basis of denitrification | url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/61/4/533?view=long&pmid=9409151 | journal = Microbiol.

===ATP replenishment by nucleoside diphosphate kinases===
ATP can also be synthesized through several so-called "replenishment" reactions catalyzed by the enzyme families of [[nucleoside diphosphate kinase]]s (NDKs), which use other nucleoside triphosphates as a high-energy phosphate donor, and the [[ATP:guanido phosphotransferase family|ATP:guanido-phosphotransferase]] family.

===ATP production during photosynthesis===
In plants, ATP is synthesized in [[thylakoid membrane]] of the [[chloroplast]] during the [[light-dependent reaction]]s of [[photosynthesis]] in a process called photophosphorylation. Here, light energy is used to pump protons across the chloroplast membrane. This produces a proton-motive force and this drives the ATP synthase, exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Allen | first = J. | title = Photosynthesis of ATP-electrons, proton pumps, rotors, and poise | journal = Cell | volume = 110 | issue = 3 | pages = 273–276 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12176312 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00870-X }}</ref> Some of the ATP produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the [[Calvin cycle]], which produces [[triose]] sugars.

===ATP recycling===
The total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.2&nbsp;[[Mole (unit)|mole]]s. The majority of ATP is not usually [[De novo synthesis|synthesised ''de novo'']], but is generated from [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] by the aforementioned processes. Thus, at any given time, the total amount of ATP + [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] remains fairly constant.

The energy used by human cells requires the [[hydrolysis]] of 100 to 150&nbsp;moles of ATP daily, which is around 50 to 75&nbsp;kg. A human will typically use up his or her body weight of ATP over the course of the day.<ref name="Di Carlo">{{cite journal |last1=Di Carlo|first1= S.&nbsp;E.  |last2=Collins|first2= H.&nbsp;L. | date= June 1, 2001 | journal= Adv. Physiol. Educ. | volume = 25 | pages= 70–71 | title= Submitting illuminations for review | url= http://advan.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/25/2/70 | issue=2 }}</ref> This means that each ATP molecule is recycled 500 to 750 times during a single day ({{nowrap|100 / 0.2 {{=}} 500}}). ATP cannot be stored, hence its consumption closely follows its synthesis. However a total of around 5&nbsp;g of ATP is used by cell processes at any time in the body.

==Regulation of biosynthesis==
ATP production in an aerobic eukaryotic cell is tightly regulated by [[allosteric]] mechanisms, by [[feedback]] effects, and by the substrate concentration dependence of individual enzymes within the glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Key control points occur in enzymatic reactions that are so energetically favorable that they are effectively irreversible under physiological conditions.

In glycolysis, [[hexokinase]] is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and [[pyruvate kinase]] is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is [[phosphofructokinase]] (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the biologically active form of the enzyme is a [[tetramer protein|tetramer]] that exists in two possible conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two [[binding site]]s for ATP&nbsp;– the [[active site]] is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly.<ref name="Voet" /> A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including [[cyclic AMP]], [[ammonium]] ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.<ref name=Voet/>

The citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates, particularly the ratio of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH and the concentrations of [[calcium]], inorganic phosphate, ATP, [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], and AMP. [[Citrate]]&nbsp;– the molecule that gives its name to the cycle&nbsp;– is a feedback inhibitor of [[citrate synthase]] and also inhibits PFK, providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis.<ref name=Voet/>

In oxidative phosphorylation, the key control point is the reaction catalyzed by [[cytochrome c oxidase]], which is regulated by the availability of its substrate&nbsp;– the reduced form of [[cytochrome c]]. The amount of reduced cytochrome c available is directly related to the amounts of other substrates:
:{{1/2}}&nbsp;NADH + cyt&nbsp;c<sub>ox</sub> + ADP + P<sub>i</sub> {{eqm}} {{1/2}}&nbsp;NAD<sup>+</sup> + cyt&nbsp;c<sub>red</sub> + ATP
which directly implies this equation:
:<math>
\frac{[\mathrm{cyt~c_{red}}]}{[\mathrm{cyt~c_{ox}}]} = \left(\frac{[\mathrm{NADH}]}{[\mathrm{NAD}]^{+}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\left(\frac{[\mathrm{ADP}] [\mathrm{P_i}]}{[\mathrm{ATP}]}\right)K_\mathrm{eq}
</math>

Thus, a high ratio of [NADH] to [NAD<sup>+</sup>] or a high ratio of [ADP][P<sub>i</sub>] to [ATP] imply a high amount of reduced cytochrome c and a high level of cytochrome c oxidase activity.<ref name=Voet/> An additional level of regulation is introduced by the transport rates of ATP and NADH between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm.<ref name=Brandolin/>

==Functions in cells==

===Metabolism, synthesis, and active transport===
ATP is consumed in the cell by energy-requiring (endergonic) processes and can be generated by energy-releasing (exergonic) processes. In this way ATP transfers energy between spatially separate [[metabolism|metabolic reactions]]. ATP is the main energy source for the majority of cellular functions. This includes the synthesis of macromolecules, including [[DNA replication|DNA]] and [[Transcription (genetics)|RNA]] (see below), and [[Translation (biology)|proteins]]. ATP also plays a critical role in the [[active transport|transport]] of macromolecules across cell membranes, e.g. [[exocytosis]] and [[endocytosis]].

===Roles in cell structure and locomotion===
ATP is critically involved in maintaining cell structure by facilitating assembly and disassembly of elements of the [[cytoskeleton]]. In a related process, ATP is required for the [[Sliding filament mechanism|shortening of actin and myosin filament crossbridges]] required for [[muscle contraction]]. This latter process is one of the main energy requirements of animals and is essential for [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] and [[Respiratory system|respiration]].

Extracellular ATP induces a wide range of pathophysiological responses via activation of purinergic P2 receptors at the cell surface.42, 43 P2X purinoceptors (P2X1–7) act as ATP-gated ion channels.42 P2X7 is involved in various inflammatory conditions, such as asthma, contact hypersensitivity and graft-versus-host diseases.44, 46, 47 In the colon tissue, MCs express high levels of P2X7.40 Our and other previous studies indicate that extracellular ATP stimulates MCs to release inflammatory cytokines (for example, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα), chemokines (for example, CCL2 and CXCL2) and lipid mediators (for example, leukotriene B4) in a P2X7-dependent manner (Figure 2);40, 48 these compounds play a critical role in the MC-mediated intestinal mucosal inflammation.

ATP can be liberated from dying cells or actively pumped out of intact cells via connexin or pannexin hemichannels, which serves as an inflammatory amplifier [26,27]. ATP and its derivatives, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine, are detected by purinergic receptors that are divided into two classes: P1 receptors detect adenosine, whereas P2 receptors recognize ATP, ADP, and other nucleotides. A number of studies have demonstrated that purinergic receptor signaling plays an important role in CNS sterile injury responses [28–31].&nbsp;... The challenge with modulating purinergic receptors following CNS injury is that individual receptors are typically expressed on multiple cell populations. For example, P2X4R and P2X7R are two commonly expressed purinergic receptors in the CNS, and their stimulation can promote inflammasome activation [32–34].&nbsp;... During a sterile injury, both CNS-resident and peripherally-derived immune cells must be regulated to prevent overactivation. Extracellular ATP, as mentioned, routinely serves as an inflammatory amplifier after injury and infection by binding to purinergic receptors [26,27]. Inflammatory responses are usually dampened as ATP is converted into adenosine by CD39 and CD79, which then binds to adenosine receptors (P1 receptors). Adenosine receptors are expressed by both CNS-resident cells as well as peripheral innate and adaptive immune cells [86,87]. There are four different types of adenosine receptor (A1, A2A, A2B, A3), and studies indicate that modulation of A2A receptor in particular has immunoregulatory effects following CNS injury.}}</ref><ref name="P2x7">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurashima Y, Amiya T, Nochi T, et al. | title = Extracellular ATP mediates mast cell-dependent intestinal inflammation through P2X7 purinoceptors | journal = Nat Commun | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 1034 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22948816 | pmc = 3658010 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms2023 | quote = Here, we showed that colitis aggravated by P2X7-mediated activation of MCs was independent of the inflammasome pathway, and that P2X7-mediated activation of MCs promoted TNFα production by effector cells to further promote intestinal inflammation44. Our findings also suggest that MCs exacerbate inflammation by recruiting neutrophils to produce abundant TNFα, but less IL-10 than is produced by other cells (for example, eosinophils, DCs and macrophages; Supplementary Fig. S10d). This neutrophil recruitment was mediated by the production of IL-1β, LTs and chemokines, which are potential targets for the treatment of colitis. Mice with experimentally induced colitis that lack CXCR2 or 5-LO (a key enzyme for converting arachidonic acid to LTs), as well as mice treated with inhibitors of CCR2, CXCR2 or 5-LO, show reduced inflammation and less neutrophil recruitment in their colons33,45,46. Moreover, given that ATP promotes neutrophil migration47, it is possible that P2X7-dependent LT and chemokine production, as well as ATP generation via AK2 and ATP synthase from MCs, could amplify neutrophil infiltration of the colon. These data collectively indicate that MCs are key factors in the induction of intestinal inflammation and also recruit neutrophils to heighten inflammatory responses. P2X7-dependent MC activation could, therefore, be a target for the treatment of intestinal inflammation.}}</ref>|small=no|date=September 2016}}

==Amino acid activation in protein synthesis==
{{main|Amino acid activation}}
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes utilize ATP as an energy source to attach a tRNA molecule to its specific amino acid, forming an aminoacyl-tRNA complex, ready for [[Translation (biology)|translation]] at [[ribosome]]s. The energy is made available by ATP hydrolysis to [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP) as two phosphate groups are removed.
Amino acid activation refers to the attachment of an amino acid to its Transfer RNA (tRNA). Aminoacyl transferase binds Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to amino acid, PP is released.  Aminoacyl transferase binds AMP-amino acid to tRNA. The AMP is used in this step.

=== Amino Acid Activation ===
During amino acid activation the amino acids (aa) are attached to their corresponding tRNA. The coupling reactions are catalysed by a group of enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (named after the reaction product aminoacyl-tRNA or aa-tRNA). The coupling reaction proceeds in two steps:

# aa + ATP --> aa-AMP + [[pyrophosphate|PP<sub>i</sub>]]
# aa-AMP + tRNA --> aa-tRNA + AMP

The amino acid is coupled to the penultimate nucleotide at the 3′-end of the tRNA (the A in the sequence CCA) via an ester bond (roll over in illustration). The formation of the ester bond conserves a considerable part of the energy from the activation reaction. This stored energy provides the majority of the energy needed for peptide bond formation during translation.

Each of the 20 amino acids are recognized by its specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. The synthetases are usually composed of one to four protein subunits. The enzymes vary considerably in structure although they all perform the same type of reaction by binding ATP, one specific amino acid and its corresponding tRNA.

The specificity of the amino acid activation is as critical for the translational accuracy as the correct matching of the codon with the anticodon. The reason is that the ribosome only sees the anticodon of the tRNA during translation. Thus, the ribosome will not be able to discriminate between tRNAs with the same anticodon but linked to different amino acids.

Some proteins that bind ATP do so in a characteristic [[tertiary structure|protein fold]] known as the [[Rossmann fold]], which is a general [[nucleotide]]-binding [[structural domain]] that can also bind the [[coenzyme]] [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rao |first1=S. |last2=Rossmann |first2=M. | title = Comparison of super-secondary structures in proteins | journal = J.

ATP in complexes with proteins, in general, requires the presence of a [[divalent]] [[cation]], almost always [[magnesium]], which binds to the ATP phosphate groups. The presence of magnesium greatly decreases the [[dissociation constant]] of ATP from its protein binding partner without affecting the ability of the enzyme to catalyze its reaction once the ATP has bound.<ref name="Saylor">{{cite journal |last1=Saylor |first1=P. |last2=Wang |first2=C. |last3=Hirai |first3=T. |last4=Adams |first4=J. | title = A second magnesium ion is critical for ATP binding in the kinase domain of the oncoprotein v-Fps | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 37 | issue = 36 | pages = 12624–12630 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9730835 | doi = 10.1021/bi9812672 }}</ref> The presence of magnesium ions can serve as a mechanism for kinase regulation.<ref name=Lin>{{cite journal |last1=Lin |first1=X. |last2=Ayrapetov |first2=M |last3=Sun |first3=G. | title = Characterization of the interactions between the active site of a protein tyrosine kinase and a divalent metal activator |pmc=1316873 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2091-6-25 | journal = BMC Biochem. | volume = 6 | pages = 25 | year = 2005| pmid = 16305747}}</ref>

==ATP analogues==
Biochemistry laboratories often use ''[[in vitro]]'' studies to explore ATP-dependent molecular processes. [[Enzyme inhibitor]]s of ATP-dependent enzymes such as [[kinase]]s are needed to examine the [[binding site]]s and [[transition state]]s involved in ATP-dependent reactions. ATP analogs are also used in [[X-ray crystallography]] to determine a [[protein structure]] in complex with ATP, often together with other substrates.
Most useful ATP analogs cannot be hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they trap the enzyme in a structure closely related to the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a [[sulfur]] atom; this molecule is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound [[vanadate]] ion. However, caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration.<ref name=Resetar>{{cite journal |last1=Resetar |first1=A.&nbsp;M. |last2=Chalovich |first2=J.&nbsp;M. | year=1995 | title= Adenosine 5′-(gamma-thiotriphosphate): an ATP analog that should be used with caution in muscle contraction studies | volume=34 | issue=49 | pages=16039–16045 | pmid=8519760 | doi = 10.1021/bi00049a018 | journal= Biochemistry}}</ref>
