'''Abersychan''' is a settlement and [[community (Wales)|community]] north of [[Pontypool]] in [[Torfaen]], [[Wales]], and lies within the boundaries of the [[Monmouthshire (historic)|historic county of Monmouthshire]] and the [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved county]] of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]].

Abersychan lies in the narrow northern section of the [[Afon Lwyd]] valley.

The town includes two schools; [[Abersychan Comprehensive School]] and Victoria Primary School; together with various shops and other amenities including Abersychan Rugby Club.

Abersychan was the birthplace of the politicians [[Roy Jenkins]], [[Don Touhig]] and [[Paul Murphy (UK politician)|Paul Murphy]] (MP for Torfaen); and of the [[rugby football]]ers [[Wilfred Hodder]], [[Candy Evans]] and [[Bryn Meredith]].

==History==
[[File:British_Ironworks_office,_Abersychan.jpg|thumb|left|The ironwork's derelict main office building, designed by architect [[Decimus Burton]]]]
[[File:Abersychan Limestone Railway, Abersychan.JPG|thumb|left|Abersychan Limestone Railway]]
[[File:Disused mine building - geograph.org.uk - 558135.jpg|thumb|left|Disused pumping engine house at British Colliery]]
Like many of the 17th century isolated agricultural hamlets in the forested South Wales Valleys, Abersychan became a thriving industrial centre in the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly for iron production.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Abersychan|volume=1|page=61}}</ref>

After the discovery of iron stone locally, the principal ironworks were built by the [[British Iron Company]] in 1825, served mainly by the LNWR's [[Brynmawr and Blaenavon Railway]]. The ironwork's main office building and [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] were designed by architect [[Decimus Burton]], best known for his design of [[London Zoo]].<ref name=BBC37235240/> The works passed to the New British Iron Company in 1843 and to the [[Ebbw Vale]] Company in 1852, before closing in 1889. On 6 February 1890, an underground [[explosion]] at Llanerch Colliery killed 176.<ref>{{cite web|title=Llanerch Colliery, Abersychan|url=http://www.welshcoalmines.co.uk/Gwent/LlanerchColliery.htm|work=Welsh Coal Mines|accessdate=14 October 2010}}</ref>

The site of the former ironworks today is a core site of {{convert|71|hectare}}, and a total land area of {{convert|526|hectare}}, includes a number of listed buildings:
*Abersychan Limestone Railway: built c 1830 to carry limestone from Cwm Lascarn quarry to the British Ironworks. 
*Air Furnace at British Ironworks
*British Colliery Pumping Engine House: a Cornish beam pumping engine house built by the British Iron Company. Built of sandstone with a slate roof, and retains several fixtures
*Cwmbyrgwm Colliery: Site of former colliery including remains of a water-balance headgear, chimney, oval shafts, water power dams, tramroad routes, and waste tips.

Various proposals have been made over the years to redevelop the site, currently under the ownership of [[HSBC]], but none have so far passed the requirements of [[Torfaen]] [[County borough|county council]].<ref name=BBC37235240>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-37235240</ref>

==Local government==
Abersychan constitutes a community and electoral ward of the [[county borough]] of [[Torfaen]]. The area was part of the ancient parish of [[Trevethin]], in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]]. On 3 June 1864 Abersychan was constituted a local government district, governed by a [[local board of health|local board]].<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~familyalbum/kbsychan.htm Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire, 1901]</ref> In 1894 Abersychan became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] and [[civil parishes in Wales|civil parish]]. The urban district was abolished in 1935, with most of its area passing to Pontypool urban district, and a small area going to [[Abercarn]] UD.

In 1974 the area became part of the borough of Torfaen, in the new local government county of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]]. The community of Abersychan was formed in 1985, but no [[community council]] has yet been formed. Abersychan and Cwmavon is now a ward for the Pontypool Community Council.<ref>The Torfaen (Communities) Order 1985 (1985 No. 129)</ref> In 1996 Torfaen became a unitary authority.

The Abersychan community includes Abersychan, [[Cwmavon, Torfaen|Cwmavon]], [[Garndiffaith]], [[Pentwyn, Torfaen|Pentwyn]], [[Talywain]], [[Varteg]], and [[Victoria Village, Torfaen|Victoria Village]].
