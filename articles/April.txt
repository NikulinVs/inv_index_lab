'''April''' is the fourth [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], the fifth in the early [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and the first month to have the length of 30 days. And it is the spring in the northern hemisphere and autumn in the southern hemisphere.

April is commonly associated with the season of [[Spring (season)|spring]] in parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and [[autumn]] in parts of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], where it is the seasonal equivalent to [[October]] in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.

==Background==
[[File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry avril.jpg|right|thumb|April from the ''[[Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]'']]

The Romans gave this month the [[Latin]] name ''[[Aprilis]]''<ref name=Chambers>"April" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;497.</ref> but the derivation of this name is uncertain. The traditional etymology is from the verb ''aperire'', "to open", in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to "open", which is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of [[wikt:άνοιξη#Greek|άνοιξη]] (''ánixi'') (opening) for spring. Since some of the Roman months were named in honor of divinities, and as April was sacred to the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], her [[Veneralia]] being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month '''Aphrilis''', from her equivalent Greek goddess name [[Aphrodite]] (''Aphros''), or from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name ''[[Aphrodite|Apru]]''. [[Jacob Grimm]] suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, ''Aper'' or ''Aprus''.<ref>Jacob Grim ''Geschichte der deutschen Sprache''. Cap. "Monate"</ref>

April was the second month of the earliest [[Roman calendar]], before ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' were added by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700&nbsp;BC. It became the fourth month of the calendar year (the year when twelve months are displayed in order) during the time of the [[decemvirs]] about 450&nbsp;BC, when it also was given 29&nbsp;days. The 30th day was added during the reform of the calendar undertaken by [[Julius Caesar]] in the mid-40s&nbsp;BC, which produced the Julian calendar.

The [[Anglo-Saxons]] called April ''ēastre-monaþ''. The [[Venerable Bede]] says in ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' that this month ''ēastre'' is the root of the word [[Easter]]. He further states that the month was named after a goddess ''[[Eostre]]'' whose feast was in that month. It is also attested by [[Einhard]] in his work, [[Vita Karoli Magni]].

[[St George]]'s day is the twenty-third of the month; and [[St Mark]]'s Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth.

In [[History of China|China]] the symbolic ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood took place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to April.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In Finnish April is ''huhtikuu'', meaning ''[[slash-and-burn]] moon'', when [[gymnosperm]]s for beat and burn clearing of farmland were felled.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In [[Slovene language|Slovene]], the most established traditional name is ''mali traven'', meaning the month when plants start growing. It was first written in 1466 in the [[Škofja Loka manuscript]].<ref name="KoledarDPG2007">{{cite journal |url=http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |title=Koledar prireditev v letu 2007 in druge informacije občine Dobrova–Polhov Gradec |language=Slovenian |trans_title=The Calendar of Events and Other Information of the Municipality of Dobrova–Polhov Gradec <!-- |issn=C505-5857 --> |publisher=Municipality of Dobrova-Polhov Gradec |year=2006}}</ref>'

The month Aprilis had 30&nbsp;days; [[Numa Pompilius]] made it 29&nbsp;days long; finally [[Julius Caesar]]’s calendar reform made it again 30&nbsp;days long, which was not changed in the calendar revision of [[Julian calendar|Augustus Caesar]] in 8&nbsp;BC.

In [[Ancient Rome]], the festival of [[Cerealia]] was held for seven days from mid-to-late April, but exact dates are uncertain. [[Feriae Latinae]] was also held in April, with the date varying. Other ancient Roman observances include [[Veneralia]] (April 1),  [[Megalesia]] (April 10–16), [[Fordicidia]] (April 15), [[Parilia]] (April 21), [[Vinalia|Vinalia Urbana]], [[Robigalia]],  and [[Serapia]] were celebrated on (April 25). [[Floralia]] was held April 27 during the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], or April 28 on the [[Julian calendar]], and lasted until May 3. However, these dates do not correspond to the modern [[Gregorian calendar]].

The [[Lyrids]] [[meteor shower]] appears on April 16-April 26 each year, with the peak generally occurring on April 22. [[Eta Aquariids]] meteor shower also appears in April. It is visible from about April 21 to about May 20 each year with peak activity on or around May 6. The [[Pi Puppids]] appear on April 23, but only in years around the parent comet's [[perihelion]] date. The [[Virginids]] also shower at various dates in April.

The "Days of April" (''journées d'avril'') is a name appropriated in French history to a [[July Monarchy#April 1834 insurrections|series of insurrections]] at Lyons, Paris and elsewhere, against the government of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] in 1834, which led to violent repressive measures, and to a famous trial known as the ''procès d'avril''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
