An '''anxiolytic''' (also '''antipanic''' or '''antianxiety agent''')<ref>{{DorlandsDict|nine/100020674|antianxiety agent}}</ref> is a medication or other intervention that inhibits [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]]. This effect is in contrast to [[anxiogenic]] agents, which increase anxiety.  Together these categories of [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] compounds or interventions may be referred to as [[anxiotropic]] compounds or agents. Some [[Recreational drug use|recreational drugs]] such as [[ethanol]] ([[ethanol|alcohol]]) induce anxiolysis initially; however, studies show that many of these drugs are anxiogenic. Anxiolytic [[medication]]s have been used for the treatment of [[anxiety disorder]] and its related psychological and physical symptoms. Anxiolytics have been shown to be useful in the treatment of anxiety disorder. [[Light therapy]] and other interventions have also been found to have an anxiolytic effect.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-7-62 |title=Does bright  light have an anxiolytic effect? – an open trial |year=2007 |last1=Youngstedt |first1=Shawn D. |last2=Kripke |first2=Daniel F. |journal=BMC Psychiatry |volume=7 |pages=62 |pmid=17971237 |pmc=2194679}}</ref>

[[Beta-receptor blocker]]s such as [[propranolol]] and [[oxprenolol]], although not anxiolytics, can be used to combat the somatic symptoms of anxiety such as [[tachycardia]] and [[palpitation]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hayes |first1=Peggy E. |last2=Schulz |first2=S.

Anxiolytics are also known as '''minor [[tranquilizer]]s'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/anxiolytic+tranquilizer|title=anxiolytic (tranquilizer)|work=Memidex (WordNet) Dictionary/Thesaurus |accessdate=2010-12-02}}</ref> The term is less common in modern texts and was originally derived from a dichotomy with [[major tranquilizer]]s, also known as [[neuroleptics]] or [[antipsychotics]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

There are concerns that some [[GABAergic]]s, such as [[benzodiazepine]]s and [[barbiturate]]s, may have an [[anxiogenic]] effect if used over long periods of time.<ref>Galanter, Marc (1 July 2008).

ISBN 978-1-58562-276-4.</ref>

==Medications==

===Barbiturates===
{{Main article|Barbiturate}}

[[Barbiturate]]s exert an anxiolytic effect linked to the sedation they cause. The risk of abuse and addiction is high. Many experts consider these drugs obsolete for treating anxiety but valuable for the short-term treatment of severe insomnia, though only after benzodiazepines or non-benzodiazepines have failed.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Benzodiazepines===
{{Main article|Benzodiazepine}}

Benzodiazepines are prescribed for short-term or episodic relief of severe and disabling anxiety. Benzodiazepines may also be indicated to cover the latent periods associated with the medications prescribed to treat an underlying anxiety disorder. They are used to treat a wide variety of conditions and symptoms and are usually a first choice when short-term [[Central nervous system|CNS]] [[sedation]] is needed. Longer-term uses include treatment for severe anxiety. 
If benzodiazepines are discontinued rapidly after being taken daily for two or more weeks there is some risk of [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]] and [[rebound syndrome]], which varies by the specific drug.<ref name="Cassano">{{Cite journal|last=Cassano|first=Giovanni B.|last2=Rossi|first2=Nicolò Baldini|last3=Pini|first3=Stefano|date=2002|title=Psychopharmacology of anxiety disorders|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=4|issue=3|pages=271–285|issn=1294-8322|pmc=3181684|pmid=22033867}}</ref> Tolerance and dependence may also occur, but may be clinically acceptable.<ref>Gelder, M, Mayou, R. and Geddes, J. 2005.

* [[Alprazolam]] (Xanax)
* [[Bromazepam]] (Lectopam, Lexotan)
* [[Chlordiazepoxide]] (Librium)
* [[Clonazepam]] (Klonopin, Rivotril)
* [[Clorazepate]] (Tranxene)
* [[Diazepam]] (Valium)
* [[Flurazepam]] (Dalmane)
* [[Lorazepam]] (Ativan)
* [[Oxazepam]] (Serax, Serapax)
* [[Temazepam]] (Restoril)
* [[Triazolam]] (Halcion)

Benzodiazepines exert their anxiolytic properties at moderate dosage. At higher dosage [[hypnotic]] properties occur.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S0004-282X2005000300009 |title=Neuromodulatory effects of caffeine and bromazepam on visual event-related potential (P300): A comparative study |year=2005 |last1=Montenegro |first1=Mariana |last2=Veiga |first2=Heloisa |last3=Deslandes |first3=Andréa |last4=Cagy |first4=Maurício |last5=McDowell |first5=Kaleb |last6=Pompeu |first6=Fernando |last7=Piedade |first7=Roberto |last8=Ribeiro |first8=Pedro |journal=Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria |volume=63 |issue=2b |pages=410–5 |pmid=16059590}}</ref>

* [[Tofisopam]] (Emandaxin and Grandaxin) is a drug that is a benzodiazepine derivative. Like other benzodiazepines, it possesses anxiolytic properties, but, unlike other benzodiazepines, it does not have anticonvulsant, sedative, skeletal muscle relaxant, motor skill-impairing, or amnestic properties.

=== Carbamates ===
Marketed as a safer alternative to barbiturate anxiolytics, [[meprobamate]] (Miltown, Equanil) was commonly used to relieve anxiety in the late 1950s and 1960s. Like barbiturates, therapeutic doses produce sedation and significant overdoses may be fatal. In the US, meprobamate has generally been replaced with benzodiazepines while the drug is now withdrawn in many European countries and Canada. The muscle relaxant [[carisoprodol]] has anxiolytic effects by metabolizing to meprobamate. Various other [[carbamate]]<nowiki/>s have been found to share these effects, such as [[tybamate]] and [[lorbamate]].

===Opioids===
[[Opioid]]s are drugs that are usually only prescribed for their painkilling properties, but some research is beginning to find that some varieties are effective at treating depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and other ailments often associated with or caused by anxiety.  They have a very high potential for abuse and have one of the highest addiction rates for all drugs.  Many people become addicted to these drugs because they are so effective at blocking emotional pain, including anxiety.  Similarly to alcohol, people with anxiety disorders are more likely to become addicted to opioids due to their anxiolytic effect.  These drugs range from the commonly prescribed [[hydrocodone]], to the often illegal [[Diamorphine]], and all the way to much more potent varieties like [[fentanyl]] often used in trauma or end of life pain management. Most people purchasing these drugs illegally are seeking them out to get a euphoric like high, but many others seek them out because they are so effective at reducing both physical pain and emotional pain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heroin addiction and anxiety disorder|url=http://www.dualdiagnosis.org/heroin-and-anxiety-disorder|website=DualDiagnosis|accessdate=16 April 2016}}</ref>

Because of their high potential for abuse and high overdose rates, prescribing opioids for mental health issues is very uncommon and frowned upon within the medical community. Safer opioids which are less likely to be abused, have less deadly drug interactions, and are less likely to cause overdose are the ones that are being looked into the most for their anxiolytic-type properties. Given that many anxiety sufferers are more prone to alcohol and opioid addiction, the potential danger in prescribing opioids is apparent. Benzodiazepines are very similar to alcohol in how they impact the user and the brain, and even though anxiety sufferers are more prone to alcohol addiction these drugs are still prescribed.  The same logic is being used in the push to get opioids used for anxiety treatment. Opioids and benzodiazepines are very dangerous to use together, and using them together is one of the most common reasons for accidental mixed drug overdose in the United States, so great caution should be taken if opioid prescriptions for anxiety become more accepted.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

It appears that [[buprenorphine]] is gaining some acceptability within in the medical community for being used to treat anxiety, OCD, and depression.  Buprenorphine is similar to methadone in that it is used in opioid replacement therapy as well as pain management.  It is much safer than methadone and lots of other opioids and has a very long half-life leading to less compulsive use among those who attempt to abuse it or become mentally addicted to it.  There has been research into more commonly abused opioids being prescribed for anxiety disorder, but given that these drugs produce more euphoria and require more constant dosing when compared to buprenorphine, there is a much higher danger for abuse and overdose.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Liddell MB, Aziz V, Briggs P, Kanakkehewa N, Rawi O |title=Buprenorphine augmentation in the treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder |journal=Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=15–9 |year=2013 |pmid=23983988 |pmc=3736962 |doi=10.1177/2045125312462233 }}</ref>

=== Antidepressants ===
Antidepressant medications can reduce anxiety, and several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been [[Food and Drug Administration|USFDA]] approved to treat various anxiety disorders. Antidepressants are especially beneficial because anxiety and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] often [[Comorbidity|occur together]].<ref name="Cassano" />

==== Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ====
[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] or serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors<ref name="BARLOW">{{cite book |author=Barlow, David H. |author2=Durand, Mark V |title=Abnormal Psychology: An Integrative Approach |edition=Fifth |page=239 |chapter=Chapter 7: Mood Disorders and Suicide |isbn=0-495-09556-7 |oclc=192055408 |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning |year=2009}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}</ref> (SSRIs) are a class of compounds typically used in the treatment of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]] and some [[personality disorder]]s. Primarily classified as antidepressants, most SSRIs have anxiolytic effects, although at higher dosages than used to treat depression. Paradoxically, SSRIs can [[Anxiogenic|increase anxiety]] initially due to negative feedback through the serotonergic [[autoreceptors]]. For this reason a concurrent benzodiazepine is sometimes used temporarily until the anxiolytic effect of the SSRI occurs.

==== Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ====
[[Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]] include [[venlafaxine]] and [[duloxetine]] drugs. Venlafaxine, in [[extended release]] form, and duloxetine, are indicated for the treatment of [[Generalized anxiety disorder|GAD]]. SSNRIs are as effective as SSRIs in the treatment of anxiety disorders.<ref name=Vanin>{{cite book |title=Anxiety Disorders: A Pocket Guide For Primary Care |author1=John Vanin |author2=James Helsley |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |date=19 June 2008 |page=189}}</ref>

==== Tricyclic antidepressants ====
[[Tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) have anxiolytic effects; however, side effects are often more troubling or severe and overdose is dangerous. Examples include [[imipramine]], [[amitriptyline]], [[nortriptyline]] and [[desipramine]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==== Tetracyclic antidepressant ====

[[Mirtazapine]] has demonstrated anxiolytic effects with a better side effect profile to all other classes of antidepressants, for example it rarely causes or exacerbates anxiety. However, in many countries (such as USA and Australia), it is not specifically approved for anxiety disorders and is used off label.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==== Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ====
[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs) are effective for anxiety, but their dietary restrictions, side effects and availability of newer effective drugs, have limited their use.<ref name="Cassano" /> First generation MAO inhibitors include: [[phenelzine]], [[isocarboxazid]] and [[tranylcypromine]]. [[Moclobemide]], a reversible MAO-A inhibitor, lacks the dietary restrictions associated with classic MAOI's, The drug is used in Canada, the UK and Australia.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Sympatholytics===

[[Sympatholytic]]s are a group of anti-hypertensives which inhibit activity of the [[sympathetic nervous system]], and several medications within this group have shown anxiolytic effects as well as potential therapy for PTSD.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==== Beta blockers ====
Although not officially approved for this purpose, [[beta blocker]]s also can have an antianxiety effect.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jefferson | first1 = J.

====Selank====
[[Selank]] is an anxiolytic peptide based drug developed by the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Russian academy of sciences. Selank is a heptapeptide with the sequence Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly-Pro. It is a synthetic [[structural analog|analog]] of a human tetrapeptide [[tuftsin]]. As such, it mimics many of its effects. It has been shown to modulate the expression of [[interleukin-6]] (IL-6) and affect the balance of T helper cell cytokines. There is evidence that it may also modulate the expression of [[brain-derived neurotropic factor]] in rats.{{mcn|date=October 2015}}

====Bromantane====
[[Bromantane]] is a stimulant drug with anxiolytic properties developed in Russia during the late 1980s, which acts mainly by inhibiting the reuptake of both dopamine and serotonin in the brain, although it also has anticholinergic effects at very high doses. Study results suggest that the combination of psychostimulant and anxiolytic actions in the spectrum of psychotropic activity of bromantane is effective in treating asthenic disorders compared to placebo.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

====Hydroxyzine====
[[Hydroxyzine]] (Atarax) is an [[antihistamine]] originally approved for clinical use by the FDA in 1956. In addition to its antihistamine properties hydroxyzine possesses anxiolytic properties and is approved for the treatment of anxiety and tension. Its sedative properties are useful as a premedication before anesthesia or to induce sedation after anesthesia.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.medicinenet.com/hydroxyzine/article.htm|title= hydroxyzine (Vistaril, Atarax)|accessdate= 17 May 2008|author= medicine net|publisher= medicinenet.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080513104646/http://www.medicinenet.com/hydroxyzine/article.htm| archivedate= 13 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Hydroxyzine has been shown to be as effective as [[benzodiazepines]] in the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]], while producing fewer side-effects.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Llorca PM, Spadone C, Sol O |title=Efficacy and safety of hydroxyzine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: a 3-month double-blind study |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=63 |issue=11 |pages=1020–7 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12444816 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v63n1112}}</ref> However, in practice, hydroxyzine is rarely as efficacious as the benzodiazepines.

'''[[Picamilon]]''' is a [[prodrug]] formed by combining [[niacin]] with [[GABA]] that is able to cross the blood–brain barrier and is then hydrolyzed into GABA and niacin. It is theorized that the GABA released in this process activates [[GABA receptors]], with potential to produce an anxiolytic response.<ref name="pmid2884549">{{cite journal

===Future drugs===
Due to deficits with existing anxiolytics (either in terms of efficacy or side-effect profile), research into novel anxiolytics is active. Possible candidates for future drugs include:

* [[BNC210]]
* [[CL-218,872]]
* [[L-838,417]]
* [[SL-651,498]]
* [[S32212]]
* [[PH94B]]

===Common drugs===
Prescription-free drugs are often poor anxiolytics and often worsen the symptoms over time{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. However, they are often used for self-medication because of their wide availability (e.g. [[alcoholic beverages]]).

====Alcohol====
{{See also|Short-term effects of alcohol}}

Ethanol is used as an anxiolytic, sometimes by [[self-medication]]. [[fMRI]] can measure the anxiolytic effects of alcohol in the human brain.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0086-08.2008 |title=Why We Like to Drink: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study of the Rewarding and Anxiolytic Effects of Alcohol |year=2008 |last1=Gilman |first1=J.

W. |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=28 |issue=18 |pages=4583–91 |pmid=18448634 |pmc=2730732}}</ref>  The [[British National Formulary]] states, "Alcohol is a poor hypnotic because its [[diuretic]] action interferes with [[sleep]] during the latter part of the night." Alcohol is also known to induce alcohol-related [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref>http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa41.htm{{full citation needed|date=November 2014}}</ref>

====Inhalants====
{{see also|Inhalant abuse#Patterns of non-medical usage|Street children in Latin America#Drugs}}

The anxiolytic effects of solvents act as positive modulators of GABAA receptors (Bowen and colleagues 2006).<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Matthew O. |last1=Howard |first2=Scott E. |last2=Bowen |first3=Eric L. |last3=Garland |first4=Brian E. |last4=Perron |first5=Michael G. |last5=Vaughn |pmid=22003419 |year=2011 |title=Inhalant use and inhalant use disorders in the United States |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=18–31 |pmc=3188822 |journal=Addiction science & clinical practice}}</ref>

However, even with CBT being a viable treatment option, it can still be ineffective for many individuals. Both the Canadian and American medical associations then suggest the use of a strong but long lasting benzodiazepine such as [[clonazepam]] and [[alprazolam]] and an antidepressant, usually [[Prozac]] for its effectiveness.<ref>CMA & AMA Home medical guides 2012 & 2014, along with personal experiences and WebMD reviews</ref>{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=Self-explanatory|date=September 2015}}{{Original research inline|date=September 2015}}

Note that adolescent anxiety once the patient becomes pubescent can often turn into depression, at which time other treatments may be required.{{citation needed|reason=Source?|date=September 2015}}

[[Transcendental Meditation technique]] shows marked efficacy in treating anxiety disorders says a [[meta-analysis]] of [[randomized controlled trials]], "''TM practice is more effective than treatment as usual and most alternative treatments, with greatest effects observed in individuals with high anxiety"''<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Orme-Johnson |first1=David W. |last2=Barnes |first2=Vernon A. |title=Effects of the Transcendental Meditation Technique on Trait Anxiety: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials |journal=The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=330–41 |year=2014 |pmid=24107199 |doi=10.1089/acm.2013.0204 }}</ref>
