== History ==
{{Main article|History of Andhra Pradesh}}

A tribe named Andhra has been mentioned in the [[Sanskrit]] texts such as [[Aitareya Brahmana]] (800-500 [[BCE]]). According to ''Aitareya Brahmana'' of the [[Rig Veda]], the Andhras left north India and settled in south India.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dance Dialects of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRz5ykKRVAEC&pg=PA66 |work=Ragini Devi|publisher=Motilal Bansarsi Dass|ISBN=81-208-0674-3|accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History of Andhra Pradesh|url=http://www.aponline.gov.in/quick%20links/hist-cult/history.html|work=AP Online|publisher=[[Government of Andhra Pradesh]]|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ancient and medieval history of Andhra Pradesh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wENuAAAAMAAJ|work=P.

=== Early history ===

Archaeological evidence from places such as [[Amaravathi (village), Guntur district|Amaravati]], [[Dharanikota]] and [[Vaddamanu]] suggests that the Andhra region was part of the [[Mauryan Empire]]. Amaravati might have been a regional centre for the Mauryan rule. After the death of emperor [[Ashoka]], the Mauryan rule weakened around 200 BCE, and was replaced by several small kingships in the Andhra region.<ref name="Akira_2012">{{cite book |author=Akira Shimada |title=Early Buddhist Architecture in Context: The Great St?pa at Amar?vat?

==== Satavahana empire ====

The [[Satavahana dynasty]] dominated the Deccan region from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE.<ref name="CH_2009">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1c1UIEVH9gC&pg=PA299 |title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Asian Civilizations |author=Charles Higham |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4381-0996-1 |page=299 }}</ref> The Satavahanas have been mentioned by the names "Andhra", "Andhrara-jatiya" and "[[Andhrabhrtya|Andhra-bhrtya]]" in the [[Puranas|Puranic literature]].<ref name="SNS_1999">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC&pg=PA172 |title=Ancient Indian History and Civilization |author=Sailendra Nath Sen |publisher=New Age International |year=1999 |isbn=9788122411980 |pages=172–176 }}</ref><ref name="SC_1974">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=78I5lDHU2jQC&pg=PA37 |title=Some Early Dynasties of South India |author=Sudhakar Chattopadhyaya |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |year=1974 |pages=17–56 }}</ref> Satavahanas do not refer to themselves as "Andhra" in any of their coins or inscriptions; it could be possible that they were termed as "Andhras" because of their ethnicity or because their territory included the Andhra region.<ref name="SEA_2001">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=MBuPx1rdGYIC&pg=PA166 |title=Empires: Perspectives from Archaeology and History |editor=[[Susan E.

[[Dharanikota]] along with [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravathi]] was the capital of the later Satavahanas.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ram Sharan Sharma |title=Urban decay in India, c. 300-c. 1000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LCYiAAAAMAAJ |year=1987 |publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers |isbn=978-81-215-0045-6 |page=95 }}</ref> Amaravathi became a major trade and pilgrimage centre during the Satavahana rule. According to the Buddhist tradition, [[Nagarjuna]] lived here, possibly in second and third centuries CE.<ref>{{cite book |author=David M.

==== Ikshvakus ====

''Andhra Ikshvakus'' were one of the earliest recorded ruling dynasties of the Guntur-Krishna regions of Andhra Pradesh. They ruled the eastern Andhra country along the [[Krishna river]] during the later half of the second century [[Common Era|CE]]. [[Puranas]] called Andhra Ikshvakus ''Shri Parvatiya Andhras''.<ref name="katragadda1">{{cite book|title=History of the Andhras|url=http://www.katragadda.com/articles/HistoryOfTheAndhras.pdf|author=Durga Prasad|publisher=P. G.

It is a strong common belief among some historians that Andhra Ikshvakus were related to the mythological [[Ikshvaku Dynasty|Ikshvakus]], while some believe Andhra Ikshvakus seem to be a local tribe who adopted the title.<ref name="katragadda1" /><ref>Ancient India, A History Textbook for Class XI, Ram Sharan Sharma, [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]], India, pp. 212</ref>

Archaeological evidence has suggested that the Andhra Ikshvakus immediately succeeded the [[Satavahanas]] in the [[Krishna river]] valley. Ikshvakus have left inscriptions at [[Nagarjunakonda]], [[Jaggayyapeta]], [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] and [[Bhattiprolu]].<ref name="katragadda1" />

==== Pallavas ====
During third century [[AD]], there was utter political and military confusion in the coastal Andhra due to the invasion of the Abhiras and their allies on the last Ikshvaku remnants and the rise of the Brihatphalayanas, the Anandagotras and the Salankayanas on the other. Simha Varma of the Manchikallu stone inscription establishes the independent rule of the Pallavas in parts of the Krishna valley of Andhra Pradesh.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

During the reign of Maharaja Sivaskanda Varma of the Mayidavolu, Hirahadagalli, the early Pallavas became dominant power in the first quarter of the fourth century AD Sivaskanda Varma was the first great ruler of the early Pallavas. He extended his dominions from the [[Krishna district|Krishna]] in the north to the south [[Penner River|Pennar]] in the south and to the [[Bellary district]] in the West. He performed the [[Aswamedha]] and other Vedic sacrifices.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Most of the Pallava Prakrit and Sanskrit charters from the southern Andhra country intimately connects them with the history of southern Andhra. The influence of the Pallavas was still felt by Andhra till it was swept by the Western Chalukyan invasion led by Pulakesin II in the first quarter of the seventh century AD. The Pallavas were not a recognised political power before the 2nd century AD. Pallavas were originally executive officers under the Satavahana kings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ancient and medieval history of Andhra Pradesh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wENuAAAAMAAJ|work=P. Raghunadha Rao|publisher=Sterling Publishers, 1993|page=68|accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref>

==== Vishnukundinas ====
Since the fall of the Ikshvakus, the [[Vishnukundinas]] were the first great dynasty, which held sway way over the entire Andhra country including Kalinga and parts of Telangana and played an important and imperial role in the history of Deccan during the fifth and sixth century AD.  They had three important cities, near Eluru, Amaravati and Puranisangam.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ancient and medieval history of Andhra Pradesh and telangana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wENuAAAAMAAJ|work=P.

==== Salankayanas ====
''The Salankayanas'' were an ancient dynasty that ruled the [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]] region between Godavari and Krishna with their capital as Vengi, modern Pedavegi 12&nbsp;km from Eluru in [[West Godavari district]] of Andhra Pradesh, [[India]]'s from 300 to 440 AD. They were [[Brahmins]] and their name is derived from their symbol and [[gotra]] name, which stood for [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] (the bull of [[Shiva]]).<ref name="Ancient Indian History and civilization By S.

==== Eastern Chalukyas ====
[[Eastern Chalukyas]], or Chalukyas of [[Vengi]], were a South Indian dynasty whose kingdom was located in the present day Andhra Pradesh. Their capital was [[Vengi]] near [[Eluru]] and their dynasty lasted for around 500 years from the 7th century until c. 1130 C.E. when the Vengi kingdom merged with the Chola empire. The Vengi kingdom was continued to be ruled by Eastern Chalukyan kings under the protection of the Chola empire until 1189 C.E., when the kingdom succumbed to the Hoysalas and the Yadavas. They had their capital originally at Vengi near [[Eluru]] of the West Godavari district end later changed to [[Rajahmundry|Rajamahendravaram]] (Rajamundry).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ap.gov.in/eastern-chalukyas/|title=About Eastern Chalukyas - Official AP State Government Portal - AP State Portal|publisher=}}</ref>

The [[Chola dynasty]] ruled Andhra during the period of 1010–1200. The Chola territories stretched from the islands of the Maldives in the south to as far north as the banks of the Godavari River in Andhra Pradesh.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==== Vijayanagara Empire ====
The Vijayanagara Empire was an empire originated [[South India]], in the [[Deccan Plateau]] region in the early fourteenth century. It was established in 1336 by [[Harihara Raya I]] and his brother [[Bukka Raya I]] of [[Sangama Dynasty]].<ref name="Book of Duarte Barbosa">By James Mansel Longworth page 204</ref><ref name="The madras journal of literature and science, year 1882">edited by J C morris page 261</ref><ref name="Encyclopedia of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh">By Om Gupta, page 428-429</ref> The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off [[Islamic invasions of India|Islamic invasions]] by the end of the thirteenth century.<ref name="vidya">Nilakanta Sastry (1955), p216</ref><ref name="vidya1">Kamath (2001), p160</ref> It lasted until 1646 although its power declined after a major military defeat in 1565 to the [[Deccan sultanates]]. The empire is named after its capital city of [[Vijayanagara]], whose ruins surround present day [[Hampi]], now a [[World Heritage Site]] in [[Karnataka]], [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Master Plan for Hampi Local Planning Area|url=http://www.bellary.nic.in/HMP/REPORT%20PDFs/CHAPTER-2.pdf}}</ref>

The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at [[Hampi]]. The Vijayanagara empire's time is considered as the golden era of South India in many aspects by historian be it prosperity, welfare, wealth, military might and nurturing of arts.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The previous temple building traditions in South India came together in the [[Vijayanagara Architecture]] style. The mingling of all faiths and vernaculars inspired architectural innovation of [[Hindu]] temple construction, first in the Deccan and later in the [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian]] idioms using the local [[granite]]. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Sanskrit]], while [[Carnatic music]] evolved into its current form.

These Ghats have rich biological diversity with a wide variety of plants, birds and lesser forms of animal life. The vegetation found in the state is largely of dry deciduous types with a mixture of [[teak]], ''[[Terminalia (plant)|Terminalia]]'', ''[[Dalbergia]]'', ''[[Pterocarpus]]'', ''[[Anogeissus]]'', etc.
The state possesses some rare and endemic plants like ''[[Cycas beddomei]]'', ''[[Pterocarpus santalinus]]'', ''Terminalia pallida'', ''Syzygium alternifolium'', ''Shorea talura'', ''Shorea tumburgia'', ''[[Psilotum nudum]]'', etc.<ref name="flora and fauna" />

=== Climate ===
The climate of Andhra Pradesh varies considerably, depending on the geographical region. Monsoons play a major role in determining the climate of the state. Summers last from March to June. In the coastal plain, the summer temperatures are generally higher than the rest of the state, with temperature ranging between 20&nbsp;°C and 41&nbsp;°C.

July to September is the season for tropical rains in Andhra Pradesh. The state receives heavy rainfall from the southwest monsoon during these months. About one third of the total rainfall in Andhra Pradesh is brought by the [[northeast monsoon]]. October and November see low-pressure systems and tropical cyclones form in the Bay of Bengal which, along with the northeast monsoon, bring rains to the southern and coastal regions of the state. November, December, January, and February are the winter months in Andhra Pradesh. Since the state has a long coastal belt the winters are not very cold. The range of winter temperature is generally 12&nbsp;°C to 30&nbsp;°C.<ref name="tourisminap.com">{{cite web|author=Aptdc, Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation|url=http://www.tourisminap.com/know_ap/index.php |title=APTDC – Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation|publisher=Tourisminap.com|date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100806000215/http://www.tourisminap.com/know_ap/index.php| archivedate= 6 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

Until 1962, the CPI, along with socialist parties namely [[Praja Socialist Party]] and Krishi Lok Party played an important role in the 1950s. In the 1967 state assembly elections, all socialist parties were eliminated and [[CPI]] lost opposition party status. The first Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh was [[Neelam Sanjiva Reddy]] who later served as President of India.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/kiran-beats-pv-rosaiah-anjaiah-in-tenure/article4132949.ece|title= The Hindu, November 25, 2012|accessdate= 20 December 2013 | location=Chennai, India|date=25 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3529044.ece?homepage=true|title= The Hindu, on the election and Presidency|accessdate= 20 December 2013 | location=Chennai, India|date=15 June 2012}}</ref>

In 1983, the [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) won the state elections and [[N.T. Rama Rao]] became the chief minister of the state for the first time.
