{{Infobox aluminium}}
'''Aluminium''' or '''aluminum''' (in [[North American English]])  is a [[chemical element]] in the [[boron group]] with symbol&nbsp;'''Al''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;13. It is a silvery-white, soft, nonmagnetic, [[ductility|ductile]] [[metal]].  Aluminium is the third most [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|abundant element in the Earth's crust]] (after [[oxygen]] and [[silicon]]) and its most abundant metal.  Aluminium makes up about 8% of the crust by mass, though it is less common in the mantle below. Aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that [[Native metal|native specimens]] are rare and limited to extreme [[Redox|reducing]] environments. Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different [[mineral]]s.<ref>

Aluminium is remarkable for the metal's low [[density]] and its ability to resist [[corrosion]] through the phenomenon of [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]. Aluminium and its [[aluminium alloy|alloys]] are vital to the [[aerospace]] industry and important in [[transport]]ation and structures, such as building facades and window frames.{{clarify|date=September 2015}} The [[oxides]] and [[sulfates]] are the most useful compounds of aluminium.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Despite its prevalence in the environment, no known form of life uses aluminium [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] [[metabolically]], but aluminium is well tolerated by plants and animals.<ref name=Ullmann/> Because of these salts' abundance, the potential for a biological role for them is of continuing interest, and studies continue.

===Physical===
Aluminium is a relatively soft, durable, lightweight, [[ductility|ductile]], and [[malleable]] [[metal]] with appearance ranging from silvery to dull gray, depending on the surface roughness. It is nonmagnetic and does not easily ignite. A fresh film of aluminium serves as a good reflector (approximately 92%) of [[visible light]] and an excellent reflector (as much as 98%) of medium and far [[infrared]] radiation. The [[yield (engineering)|yield strength]] of pure aluminium is 7–11 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]], while [[aluminium alloy]]s have yield strengths ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa.<ref name="polmear">{{cite book

===Chemical===
[[Corrosion]] resistance can be excellent because a thin surface layer of [[aluminium oxide]] forms when the bare metal is exposed to air, effectively preventing further [[oxidation]],<ref name="CorrAl">{{cite book | title=Corrosion of Aluminium|first=Christian |last=Vargel|date=2004|origyear=French edition published 1999|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0-08-044495-4|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NAABS5KrVDYC&pg=PA81}}</ref> in a process termed [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]].  The strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to [[galvanic cell|galvanic]] reactions with alloyed [[copper]].<ref name="polmear" /> This corrosion resistance is greatly reduced by aqueous salts, particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals.

In highly acidic solutions, aluminium reacts with water to form hydrogen, and in highly alkaline ones to form [[aluminates]]— protective passivation under these conditions is negligible.  Primarily because it is corroded by dissolved [[chlorides]], such as common [[sodium chloride]], household plumbing is never made from aluminium.<ref name="Beal1999">{{cite book|first=Roy E. |last= Beal|title=Engine Coolant Testing : Fourth Volume|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Askwi3lXdlcC&pg=PA90|date=1 January 1999|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=978-0-8031-2610-7|page=90}}</ref>

However, because of its general resistance to corrosion, aluminium is one of the few metals that retains silvery reflectance in finely powdered form, making it an important component of [[silver (color)|silver-colored]] paints. Aluminium mirror finish has the highest [[reflectance]] of any metal in the 200–400&nbsp;nm ([[ultraviolet|UV]]) and the 3,000–10,000&nbsp;nm (far [[infrared|IR]]) regions; in the 400–700&nbsp;nm visible range it is slightly outperformed by [[tin]] and [[silver]] and in the 700–3000&nbsp;nm (near IR) by [[silver]], [[gold]], and [[copper]].<ref>

Aluminium is [[oxidized]] by [[water]] at temperatures below 280&nbsp;°C to produce [[hydrogen]], [[aluminium hydroxide]] and heat:
:2 Al + 6 H<sub>2</sub>O → 2 Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>
This conversion is of interest for the production of hydrogen. However, commercial application of this fact has challenges in circumventing the passivating oxide layer, which inhibits the reaction, and in storing the energy required to regenerate the aluminium metal.<ref>{{cite web|date=1 January 2008|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/aluminium_water_hydrogen.pdf| title=Reaction of Aluminum with Water to Produce Hydrogen| publisher=U.S. Department of Energy}}</ref>

===Isotopes===
{{Main article|Isotopes of aluminium}}
Aluminium has many known [[isotope]]s, with mass numbers range from 21 to 42; however, only <sup>27</sup>Al ([[stable isotope|stable]]) and <sup>26</sup>Al ([[radioactive decay|radioactive]], [[half-life|t<sub>1⁄2</sub>]]&nbsp;= 7.2×10<sup>5</sup> years) occur naturally. <sup>27</sup>Al has a natural abundance above 99.9%. <sup>26</sup>Al is produced from [[argon]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] by [[spallation]] caused by [[cosmic-ray]] [[proton]]s. Aluminium isotopes are useful in dating [[ocean|marine]] sediments, manganese nodules, glacial ice, [[quartz]] in [[rock (geology)|rock]] exposures, and [[meteorite]]s. The ratio of <sup>26</sup>Al to <sup>10</sup>[[beryllium|Be]] has been used to study transport, deposition, [[sediment]] storage, burial times, and erosion on 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> year time scales.<ref>

After falling to Earth, atmospheric shielding drastically reduces <sup>26</sup>Al production, and its decay can then be used to determine the meteorite's terrestrial age. Meteorite research has also shown that <sup>26</sup>Al was relatively abundant at the time of formation of our planetary system. Most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by the decay of <sup>26</sup>Al was responsible for the melting and [[planetary differentiation|differentiation]] of some [[asteroids]] after their formation 4.55 billion years ago.<ref>

In the [[Earth's crust]], aluminium is the most abundant (8.3% by mass) metallic element and the third most abundant of all elements (after oxygen and silicon).<ref name=Greenwood1997>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|page=217}}</ref> The Earth's crust has a greater abundance of aluminium than the rest of the planet, primarily in aluminium silicates. In the Earths [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], which is only 2% aluminium by mass, these aluminium silicate minerals are largely replaced by [[silica]] and magnesium oxides. Overall, the Earth is about 1.4% aluminium by mass (eighth in abundance by mass). Aluminium occurs in greater proportion in the Earth than in the Solar system and Universe because the more common elements (hydrogen, helium, neon, nitrogen, carbon as hydrocarbon) are volatile at Earth's proximity to the Sun and large quantities of those were lost.

Because of its strong affinity for oxygen, aluminium is almost never found in the elemental state; instead it is found in oxides or silicates. [[Feldspar]]s, the most common group of minerals in the Earth's crust, are aluminosilicates. Native aluminium metal can only be found as a minor phase in low oxygen [[fugacity]] environments, such as the interiors of certain volcanoes.<ref>

Aluminium also occurs in the minerals [[beryl]], [[cryolite]], [[garnet]], [[spinel]], and [[turquoise]]. Impurities in Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, such as [[chromium]] and [[iron]], yield the [[gemstone]]s [[ruby]] and [[sapphire]], respectively.

Although aluminium is a common and widespread element, not all aluminium minerals are economically viable sources of the metal. Almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the [[ore]] bauxite (AlO<sub>''x''</sub>(OH)<sub>3–2''x''</sub>). Bauxite occurs as a [[weathering]] product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions.<ref>

==Production and refinement==
{{See also|Category:Aluminium minerals|List of countries by aluminium production}}
[[File:Bauxite hérault.JPG|thumb||Bauxite, a major aluminium ore. The red-brown color is due to the presence of [[iron]] minerals.]]

===Bayer process and Hall–Héroult processes===
Bauxite is converted to aluminium oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) by the [[Bayer process]].<ref name=Ullmann/> Relevant [[chemical equation]]s are:
:Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>  +  2 NaOH  →  2 NaAlO<sub>2</sub>   + H<sub>2</sub>O 
:2 H<sub>2</sub>O  +  NaAlO<sub>2</sub>   →   Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>  +  NaOH
The intermediate, sodium aluminate, with the simplified formula NaAlO<sub>2</sub>, is soluble in strongly alkaline water, and the other components of the ore are not. Depending on the quality of the bauxite ore, twice as much waste ("[[Bauxite tailings]]") as alumina is generated.

The conversion of alumina to aluminium metal is achieved by the [[Hall–Héroult process]]. In this energy-intensive process, a solution of alumina in a molten ({{convert|950|and|980|C|F}}) mixture of [[cryolite]] (Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>) with [[calcium fluoride]] is [[electrolysis|electrolyzed]] to produce metallic aluminium:
: Al<sup>3+</sup> + 3 e<sup>−</sup> →  Al
The liquid aluminium metal sinks to the bottom of the solution and is tapped off, and usually cast into large blocks called [[Bar stock|aluminium billets]] for further processing.  Carbon dioxide is produced at the carbon anode:
: 2 O<sup>2−</sup>  +  C   →   CO<sub>2</sub>  +  4 e<sup>−</sup>
The carbon anode is consumed by reaction with oxygen to form carbon dioxide gas, with a small quantity of [[fluoride]] gases. In modern smelters, the gas is filtered through alumina to remove fluorine compounds and return aluminium fluoride to the [[electrolytic]] cells.  The anode the reduction cell must be replaced regularly, since it is consumed in the process. The cathode is also eroded, mainly by electrochemical processes and liquid metal movement [[Electromagnetic induction|induced]] by intense electrolytic currents. After five to ten years, depending on the current used in the electrolysis, a cell must be rebuilt because of cathode wear.

[[File:Aluminium - world production trend.svg|thumb|lang=en|World production trend of aluminium]]

Aluminium electrolysis with the [[Hall–Héroult]] process consumes a lot of energy. The worldwide average specific energy consumption is approximately 15±0.5 [[kilowatt-hour|kWh]]s per kilogram of aluminium produced (52 to 56 [[megajoule|MJ]]/kg). Some smelters achieve approximately 12.8&nbsp;kW·h/kg (46.1 MJ/kg). (Compare this to the [[heat of reaction]], 31 MJ/kg, and the [[Gibbs free energy]] of reaction, 29 MJ/kg.) Minimizing line currents for older technologies are typically 100 to 200 [[kiloampere]]s; state-of-the-art smelters operate at about 350 kA.

The Hall–Heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above 99%. Further purification can be done by the [[Hoopes process]]. This process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium, barium and aluminium fluoride electrolyte. The resulting aluminium has a purity of 99.99%.<ref name=Ullmann>

===Aluminium chloride electrolysis process===
The high energy consumption of [[Hall–Héroult]] process motivated the development of the electrolytic process based on [[aluminium chloride]]. The pilot plant with 6500 tons/year output was started in 1976 by [[Alcoa]]. The plant offered two advantages: (i) energy requirements were 40% less than plants using the Hall–Héroult process, and (ii) the more accessible [[kaolinite]] (instead of [[bauxite]] and [[cryolite]]) was used for feedstock.  Nonetheless, the pilot plant was shut down. The reasons for failure were the cost of aluminium chloride, general technology maturity problems, and leakage of the trace amounts of toxic [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] compounds.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://cecri.csircentral.net/2112/1/21-1985.pdf|author1=Kannan, G.N.  |author2=Desikan, P.S. |year=1985|title= Critical appraisal and review of aluminium chloride electrolysis for the production of aluminium|journal= Bulletin of Electrochemistry |volume=1 |issue=5|pages= 483–488}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Aluminum Recycling and Processing for Energy Conservation and Sustainability|author=Green, John A. S. |page=197|publisher=ASM International|year= 2007|isbn=1615030573}}</ref>

Aluminium chloride process can also be used for the co-production of [[titanium]], depending on titanium contents in [[kaolinite]].

===Aluminium carbothermic process===
The non-electrolytic ''aluminium [[carbothermic reaction|carbothermic]]'' process of aluminium production would theoretically be cheaper and consume less energy. However, it has been in the experimental phase for decades because the high operating temperature creates difficulties in material technology that have not yet been solved.<ref>[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/manufacturing/resources/aluminum/pdfs/act-arp.pdf Aluminum Carbothermic Technology Advanced Reactor Process].

===Recycling===
[[File:41 ALU Recycling Code.svg|150px|thumb|Aluminium [[recycling code]]]]
{{Main article|Aluminium recycling}}
Aluminium is theoretically 100% recyclable without any loss of its natural qualities. According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the global [[per capita]] stock of aluminium in use in society (i.e. in cars, buildings, electronics etc.) is {{convert|80|kg|abbr=on}}. Much of this is in more-developed countries ({{convert|350|–|500|kg|abbr=on}} per capita) rather than less-developed countries ({{convert|35|kg|abbr=on}} per capita). Knowing the per capita stocks and their approximate lifespans is important for planning recycling.

Recovery of the metal through [[recycling]] has become an important task of the aluminium industry. Recycling was a low-profile activity until the late 1960s, when the growing use of aluminium [[beverage can]]s brought it to public awareness.

Recycling involves melting the scrap, a process that requires only 5% of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore, though a significant part (up to 15% of the input material) is lost as [[dross]] (ash-like oxide).<ref>

Recycled aluminium is known as secondary aluminium, but maintains the same physical properties as primary aluminium. Secondary aluminium is produced in a wide range of formats and is employed in 80% of alloy injections. Another important use is extrusion.

White dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially.<ref>

==Compounds==
{{Category see also|Aluminium compounds}}

===Oxidation state +3===
The vast majority of compounds, including all Al-containing minerals and all commercially significant aluminium compounds, feature aluminium in the oxidation state 3+. The [[coordination number]] of such compounds varies, but generally Al<sup>3+</sup> is six-coordinate or tetracoordinate. Almost all compounds of aluminium(III) are colorless.<ref name=Greenwood1997/>

====Halides====
All four [[Halide|trihalides]] are well known. Unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides, [[aluminium fluoride]] (AlF<sub>3</sub>) features six-coordinate Al. The octahedral coordination environment for AlF<sub>3</sub> is related to the compactness of the [[fluoride]] ion, six of which can fit around the small Al<sup>3+</sup> center. AlF<sub>3</sub> sublimes (with cracking) at {{convert|1291|°C|0|abbr=on}}. With heavier halides, the coordination numbers are lower. The other trihalides are [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimeric]] or [[polymer]]ic with tetrahedral Al centers. These materials are prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen, although other methods exist. [[Acid]]ification of the oxides or [[hydroxide]]s affords hydrates. In aqueous solution, the halides often form mixtures, generally containing six-coordinate Al centers that feature both halide and [[metal aquo complex|aquo ligands]]. When aluminium and fluoride are together in aqueous solution, they readily form complex ions such as {{chem|[AlF(H|2|O)|5|]|2+}}, {{chem|AlF|3|(H|2|O)|3}}, and {{chem|[AlF|6|]|3-}}. In the case of chloride, polyaluminium clusters are formed such as [Al<sub>13</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>24</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>12</sub>]<sup>7+</sup>.

====Oxide and hydroxides====
[[File:AlHydrolysis.png|thumb|right|Aluminium hydrolysis as a function of pH.{{cn|date=November 2016}} Coordinated water molecules are omitted.]]
Aluminium forms one stable oxide, known by its mineral name [[corundum]]. [[Sapphire]] and [[ruby]] are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals. The two oxide-hydroxides, AlO(OH), are [[boehmite]] and [[diaspore]]. There are three trihydroxides: [[bayerite]], [[gibbsite]], and [[nordstrandite]], which differ in their crystalline structure ([[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]]). Most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base. Heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundum. These materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful.

====Carbide, nitride, and related materials====
[[Aluminium carbide]] (Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub>) is made by heating a mixture of the elements above {{convert|1000|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The pale yellow crystals consist of tetrahedral aluminium centers. It reacts with water or dilute acids to give [[methane]]. The [[metal acetylide|acetylide]], Al<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, is made by passing [[acetylene]] over heated aluminium.

[[Aluminium nitride]] (AlN) is the only nitride known for aluminium. Unlike the oxides, it features tetrahedral Al centers. It can be made from the elements at {{convert|800|°C|0|abbr=on}}. It is air-stable material with a usefully high [[thermal conductivity]]. [[Aluminium phosphide]] (AlP) is made similarly; it hydrolyses to give [[phosphine]]:

: AlP + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O → Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> + PH<sub>3</sub>

===Organoaluminium compounds and related hydrides===
{{main article|Organoaluminium compound}}
[[File:Trimethylaluminium-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|220px|Structure of [[trimethylaluminium]], a compound that features five-coordinate carbon.]]

A variety of compounds of empirical formula AlR<sub>3</sub> and AlR<sub>1.5</sub>Cl<sub>1.5</sub> exist.<ref>

}}</ref> These species usually feature tetrahedral Al centers formed by dimerization with some R or Cl bridging between both Al atoms, e.g. "[[trimethylaluminium]]" has the formula Al<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub> (see figure). With large organic groups, triorganoaluminium compounds exist as three-coordinate monomers, such as [[triisobutylaluminium]]. Such compounds{{which|date=September 2016}}<!-- only the immediately preceding topic (large R) or all organoaluminiums? --> are widely used in industrial chemistry, despite the fact that they are often highly [[pyrophoric]]. Few analogues exist between [[Organoaluminium chemistry|organoaluminium]] and [[Organoboron chemistry|organoboron]] compounds other than{{clarify|date=September 2016}}<!-- by monomer vs dimer, by pyrophoric nature, or...? --> large organic groups.

The important{{clarify|date=September 2016}}<!-- more than others, or as a starting point for others, or just one of many important ones --> aluminium hydride is [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (LiAlH<sub>4</sub>), which is used in as a reducing agent in [[organic chemistry]]. It can be produced from [[lithium hydride]] and aluminium trichloride:

: 4 LiH + AlCl<sub>3</sub> → LiAlH<sub>4</sub> + 3 LiCl

Several useful derivatives of LiAlH<sub>4</sub> are known, e.g. [[Red-Al|sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)dihydridoaluminate]]. The simplest hydride, [[aluminium hydride]] or alane, remains a laboratory curiosity. It is a polymer with the formula (AlH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>''n''</sub>, in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride that is a dimer with the formula (BH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.

===Oxidation states +1 and +2===
Although the great majority of aluminium compounds feature Al<sup>3+</sup> centers, compounds with lower oxidation states are known and sometime of significance as precursors to the Al<sup>3+</sup> species.

====Aluminium(I)====
AlF, AlCl and AlBr exist in the gaseous phase when the trihalide is heated with aluminium. The composition {{math|AlI}} is unstable at room temperature, converting to triiodide:<ref name=al1/>

: <ce>3 AlI -> {AlI3} + 2 Al</ce>

A stable derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic [[adduct]] formed with [[triethylamine]], {{math|Al<sub>4</sub>I<sub>4</sub>(NEt<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>}}. Also of theoretical interest but only of fleeting existence are Al<sub>2</sub>O and Al<sub>2</sub>S. Al<sub>2</sub>O is made by heating the normal oxide, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, with silicon at {{convert|1800|°C|0|abbr=on}} in a [[vacuum]].<ref name=al1>

===Aluminium compounds===
Because aluminium is abundant and most of its derivatives exhibit low toxicity, the compounds of aluminium enjoy wide and sometimes large-scale applications.

====Alumina====
{{main article|Aluminium oxide}}
[[Aluminium oxide]] (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and the associated oxy-hydroxides and trihydroxides are produced or extracted from minerals on a large scale. The great majority of this material is converted to metallic aluminium. In 2013, about 10% of the domestic shipments in the United States were used for other applications.<ref name="myb2012">

 |accessdate=8 August 2014
}}</ref> One major use is to absorb water where it is viewed as a contaminant or impurity. Alumina is used to remove water from hydrocarbons in preparation for subsequent processes that would be poisoned by moisture.

Aluminium oxides are common catalysts for industrial processes; e.g. the [[Claus process]] to convert [[hydrogen sulfide]] to sulfur in [[refineries]] and to [[alkylation|alkylate]] [[amine]]s. Many industrial [[Catalysis|catalysts]] are [[catalyst support|"supported"]] by alumina, meaning that the expensive catalyst material (e.g., [[platinum]]) is dispersed over a surface of the inert alumina.

Being a very hard material ([[Mohs hardness]] 9), alumina is widely used as an abrasive; being extraordinarily chemically inert, it is useful in highly reactive environments such as [[high pressure sodium]] lamps.

====Sulfates====
Several sulfates of aluminium have industrial and commercial application. [[Aluminium sulfate]] (Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>18</sub>) is produced on the annual scale of several billions of kilograms. About half of the production is consumed in [[water treatment]]. The next major application is in the manufacture of paper. It is also used as a [[mordant]], in [[fire extinguisher]]s, in [[fireproofing]], as a [[food additive]] ([[E number]] E173), and in [[Tanning (leather)|leather tanning]]. Aluminium ammonium sulfate, which is also called [[ammonium alum]], (NH<sub>4</sub>)Al(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>·12H<sub>2</sub>O, is used as a [[mordant]] and in leather tanning,<ref name=Ullmann2>

[[Aluminium chloride]] (AlCl<sub>3</sub>) is used in [[petroleum]] [[refining]] and in the production of synthetic [[rubber]] and polymers. Although it has a similar name, [[aluminium chlorohydrate]] has fewer and very different applications, particularly as a colloidal agent in water purification and an [[antiperspirant]]. It is an intermediate in the production of aluminium metal.

====Niche compounds====

Many aluminium compounds have niche applications:
* [[Aluminium acetate]] in solution is used as an [[astringent]].
* [[Aluminium borate]] (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>·B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and [[aluminium fluorosilicate]] (Al<sub>2</sub>(SiF<sub>6</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) are used in the production of [[glass]], [[ceramic]]s, synthetic [[gemstone]]s. 
* [[Aluminium phosphate]] (AlPO<sub>4</sub>) used in the manufacture of glass, ceramic, [[Wood pulp|pulp]] and paper products, [[cosmetics]], paints, [[varnish]]es, and in dental [[cement]]. 
* [[Aluminium hydroxide]] (Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>) is used as an [[antacid]], and mordant; it is used also in [[water]] purification, the manufacture of glass and ceramics, and in the [[waterproofing]] [[Textile|fabrics]]. 
* [[Lithium aluminium hydride]] is a powerful reducing agent used in [[organic chemistry]]. 
* [[Organoaluminium chemistry|Organoaluminiums]] are used as [[Lewis acid]]s and cocatalysts.
* [[Methylaluminoxane]] is a cocatalyst for [[Ziegler-Natta]] [[olefin]] [[polymerization]] to produce [[vinyl polymer]]s such as [[polyethene]]. 
* Aqueous aluminium ions (such as aqueous aluminium sulfate) are used to treat against fish parasites such as ''[[Gyrodactylus salaris]]''. 
* In many [[vaccine]]s, certain aluminium salts serve as an immune [[Immunologic adjuvant|adjuvant]] (immune response booster) to allow the [[protein]] in the vaccine to achieve sufficient potency as an immune stimulant.

===Aluminium alloys in structural applications===
{{Main article|Aluminium alloy}}
[[File:Aluminium foam.jpg|thumb|[[Aluminium foam]]]]
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
Aluminium alloys with a wide range of properties are used in engineering structures. Alloy systems are classified by a number system ([[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]]) or by names indicating their main alloying constituents ([[DIN]] and [[International Organization of Standardization|ISO]]).

The strength and durability of aluminium alloys vary widely, not only as a result of the components of the specific alloy, but also as a result of heat treatments and manufacturing processes. A lack of knowledge of these aspects has from time to time led to improperly designed structures and gained aluminium a bad reputation.

One important structural limitation of aluminium alloys is their [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] strength. Unlike steels, aluminium alloys have no well-defined [[fatigue limit]], meaning that fatigue failure eventually occurs, under even very small cyclic loadings. Engineers must assess applications and design for a [[Fatigue (material)#Design against fatigue|fixed and finite life]] of the structure, rather than infinite life.

Another important property of aluminium alloys is sensitivity to heat. Workshop procedures are complicated by the fact that aluminium, unlike steel, melts without first glowing red. Manual [[blow torch]] operations require additional skill and experience. Aluminium alloys, like all structural alloys, are subject to internal stresses after heat operations such as welding and casting. The lower [[melting point]]<nowiki/>s of aluminium alloys make them more susceptible to distortions from thermally induced stress relief.  Stress can be relieved and controlled during manufacturing by heat-treating the parts in an oven, followed by gradual cooling—in effect [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] the stresses.

The low melting point of aluminium alloys has not precluded use in rocketry, even in combustion chambers where gases can reach 3500&nbsp;K. The [[RM-81 Agena|Agena]] upper stage engine used regeneratively cooled aluminium in some parts of the nozzle, including the thermally critical throat region.

Another alloy of some value is [[aluminium bronze]] (Cu-Al alloy).

==History==
[[File:Eros-piccadilly-circus.jpg|thumb||The statue of [[Anteros]] in [[Piccadilly Circus]], London, was made in 1893 and is one of the first statues cast in aluminium.]]

Although ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used aluminium salts as dyeing mordants and as astringents for dressing wounds, metallic aluminum was not refined until the modern era. [[Alum]], a salt of aluminum and potassium, is still used as a [[styptic]].
<!--
There is reason to believe that Romans stumbled on a technique to refine aluminium, but that the technique was lost. [[Pliny the Elder]] recounts in [[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]] the following tale, which has been interpreted<ref>
{{cite web
 |title=Aluminium in history
 |url=http://www.world-aluminium.org/?pg=13
 |publisher=[[International Aluminium Institute]]
 |accessdate=6 March 2012
}}</ref> as referring to aluminium:

<blockquote>
"One day a goldsmith in Rome was allowed to show the Emperor [[Tiberius]] a dinner plate of a new metal. The plate was very light, and almost as bright as silver. The goldsmith told the Emperor that he had made the metal from plain clay. He also assured the Emperor that only he, himself, and the Gods knew how to produce this metal from clay. The Emperor became very interested, and as a financial expert he was also a little concerned. The Emperor felt immediately, however, that all his treasures of gold and silver would decline in value if people started to produce this bright metal of clay. Therefore, instead of giving the goldsmith the regard expected, he ordered him to be beheaded."
</blockquote>

In 1782, [[Guyton de Morveau]] suggested calling the "base" of (i.e., the metallic element in) alum ''alumine.''<ref>de Morveau (1782) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015055358108;view=1up;seq=394 "Mémoire sur les dénominations chimiques, la nécessité d'en perfectionner le système, & les règles pour y parvenir"] (Memoir on chemical names, the necessity of improving the system, and rules for attaining it), ''Observations sur la physique, sur l'histoire naturelle, et sur les arts, …'', '''19''' :  370–382 ; see especially p. 378.  From p. 378:  ''"La seconde terre est celle qui sert de base à l'alun:  en la nommant argille, il faudroit chercher un autre nom au minéral, qui n'en recèle jamais qu'une portion; il faudroit, suivant notre second principe, substituer le mot argilleux au mot alumineux, pour tous ses composés.  Il est plus simple de conserver le dernier, & en tirer un substantif, pour indiquer l'étre primitif.  Ainsi, l'on dira que l'alun ou vitriol ''alumineux'' a pour base l'''alumine'', que la Nature nous offre abondamment dans les ''argilles''."''  (The second earth is what serves as the base in alum:  by naming it "clay", one would have to seek another name for the mineral, which never harbors even a part of it; one would have to, following our second principle [for naming chemical compounds], substitute the word "clay-ish" for the word "aluminous" in all its compounds.  It is simpler to retain the latter and to draw a noun from it, in order to indicate the primitive entity [i.e., element].  Thus, one will say that alum or ''aluminous'' sulfate has as [its] base ''alumine'' [i.e., aluminium], which Nature offers us abundantly in ''clays''.)</ref> In 1808, [[Humphry Davy]] identified the existence of a metal base of alum, which he at first termed ''alumium'' and later ''aluminum'' (see [[#Etymology|etymology section]], below).

The metal was first produced in 1825 in an impure form by Danish physicist and chemist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]]. He reacted [[anhydrous]] [[aluminium chloride]] with [[potassium]] [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]], yielding a lump of metal looking similar to tin.<ref>Ørsted (1827)  "Fra 31 Maj 1824 til 31 Maj 1825" ([Proceedings of the Society] from 31 May 1824 until 31 May 1825), ''Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskabs, Philosophiske og Historiske Afhandlinger'' (The Royal Danish Scientific Society, Philosophical and Historical Papers),  '''3''' :  [https://books.google.com/books?id=L2BFAAAAcAAJ&pg=PR25#v=onepage&q&f=false xxv–xxvi.]  Ørsted produced aluminium chloride (''Chlorleeræret'', chloride of clay ore) by passing chlorine over heated clay (''Leer''), and then reacted it with potassium amalgam (''Kaliamalgam''), which mixture, after distillation, left a lump of metal (''Metalklump'') resembling tin (''Tinnet''), which he called "clay metal" (''Leermetal'').</ref><ref name="woehler">

He conducted a similar experiment in 1827 by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and produced aluminium.<ref name="woehler"/> Wöhler is therefore generally credited with isolating aluminium ([[Latin]] ''alumen'', alum). Further, [[Pierre Berthier]] discovered aluminium in bauxite ore. [[Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville]] improved Wöhler's method in 1846. As described in his 1859 book, aluminium trichloride could be reduced by sodium, which was more convenient and less expensive than potassium, which Wöhler had used.<ref>

By 1895, the metal was being used as a building material as far away as [[Sydney]], Australia in the dome of the [[Chief Secretary's Building]].

With the explosive expansion of the airplane industry during World War I (1914–1917), major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light, strong airframes. They often subsidized factories and the necessary electrical supply systems.<ref>Ingulstad, Mats (2012) "'We Want Aluminum, No Excuses': Business-Government Relations in the American Aluminum Industry, 1917–1957," pp. 33–68 in ''From Warfare to Welfare: Business-Government Relations in the Aluminium Industry,'' ed. Mats Ingulstad and Hans Otto Frøland. Oslo: Tapir Academic Press, 2012.</ref>

Many navies have used an aluminium [[superstructure]] for their vessels; the 1975 fire aboard [[USS Belknap (CG-26)|USS ''Belknap'']] that gutted her aluminium superstructure, as well as observation of battle damage to British ships during the [[Falklands War]], led to many navies switching to all [[steel]] superstructures.

[[Aluminium wire]] was once widely used for [[Aluminum wire#Problems with aluminum wires|domestic electrical wiring]] in the United States, and a number of fires resulted from [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] and corrosion-induced failures at junctions and [[Terminator (electrical)|terminations]]; additional and preventable factors in the failures have been identified.<ref>[http://www.heimer.com/information/aluminum_wiring.html Home Inspection and Building Inspection: The Hazards of Aluminum Wiring].

Retrieved on 2016-07-30.</ref>  Aluminium is still used in electrical services with specially designed wire termination hardware.

==Etymology==

The various names all derive from its elemental presence in [[alum]]. The word comes into English from [[Old French]], from ''alumen'', a [[Latin]] word meaning "bitter salt".<ref>{{OEtymD|alum}}</ref>

Two variants of the name are in current use: ''aluminium'' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˌ|æ|l|j|ʊ|ˈ|m|ɪ|n|i|ə|m|}}) and ''aluminum'' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|l|uː|m|ɪ|n|ə|m}}).  There is also an obsolete variant ''alumium''. The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) adopted ''aluminium'' as the standard international name for the element in 1990 but, three years later, recognized ''aluminum'' as an acceptable variant. The IUPAC periodic table uses the ''aluminium'' spelling only.<ref>[https://iupac.org/what-we-do/periodic-table-of-elements/]. iupac.org</ref>  IUPAC internal publications use the two spelling with nearly equal frequency.<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?q=aluminum&sitesearch=iupac.org IUPAC Web site publication search for 'aluminum']. google.com</ref>

=== Different endings ===

Most countries use the ending "-ium" for "aluminium". In the United States and Canada, the ending "-um" predominates.<ref name=Greenwood1997/><ref>Bremner, John ''Words on Words: A Dictionary for Writers and Others Who Care about Words'', pp. 22–23. ISBN 0-231-04493-3.</ref> The [[Canadian Oxford Dictionary]] prefers ''aluminum'', whereas the Australian [[Macquarie Dictionary]] prefers ''aluminium''. In 1926, the [[American Chemical Society]] officially decided to use ''aluminum'' in its publications; American dictionaries typically label the spelling ''aluminium'' as "chiefly British".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aluminium |title= Aluminium – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref><ref>

</ref> The earliest citation given in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] for any word used as a name for this element is ''alumium'', which British chemist and inventor [[Humphry Davy]] employed in 1808 for the metal he was trying to isolate electrolytically from the mineral ''[[alumina]]''. The citation is from the journal ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'': "Had I been so fortunate as to have obtained more certain evidences on this subject, and to have procured the metallic substances I was in search of, I should have proposed for them the names of silicium, alumium, zirconium, and glucium."<ref>"alumium", ''Oxford English Dictionary''.

Davy settled on ''aluminum'' by the time he published his 1812 book ''Chemical Philosophy'': "This substance appears to contain a peculiar metal, but as yet Aluminum has not been obtained in a perfectly free state, though alloys of it with other metalline substances have been procured sufficiently distinct to indicate the probable nature of alumina."<ref name=Davy1812>

The ''-ium'' suffix followed the precedent set in other newly discovered elements of the time: potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and [[strontium]] (all of which Davy isolated himself). Nevertheless, element names ending in ''-um'' were not unknown at the time; for example, [[platinum]] (known to Europeans since the 16th century), [[molybdenum]] (discovered in 1778), and [[tantalum]] (discovered in 1802). The ''-um'' suffix is consistent with the universal spelling [[alumina]] for the [[oxide]] (as opposed to aluminia), as [[lanthana]] is the oxide of [[lanthanum]], and [[magnesium oxide|magnesia]], [[ceria]], and [[thoria]] are the oxides of [[magnesium]], [[cerium]], and [[thorium]] respectively.

The ''aluminum'' spelling is used in the [[Webster's Dictionary]] of 1828. In his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal in 1892, [[Charles Martin Hall]] used the ''-um'' spelling, despite his constant use of the ''-ium'' spelling in all the patents<ref name="Hall-patent"/> he filed between 1886 and 1903. Hall's domination of production of the metal ensured that ''aluminum'' became the standard English spelling in North America.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Despite its widespread occurrence in the Earth crust, aluminium has no known function in biology.

Most acid soils are saturated with aluminium rather than [[hydrogen ions]]. The acidity of the soil is therefore, a result of [[hydrolysis]] of aluminium compounds.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Turner, R.C. | author2 = Clark J.S. | last-author-amp = yes | date = 1966 | title = Lime potential in acid clay and soil suspensions | journal = Trans.

[[Wheat]] has [[adaptation|developed]] a [[adaptation|tolerance]] [[adaptation|to]] aluminium, releasing of [[organic compound]]s that bind to harmful aluminium [[cations]]. [[Sorghum]] is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism. The first gene for aluminium tolerance has been identified in wheat. It was shown that sorghum's aluminium tolerance is controlled by a single gene, as for wheat.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Comparative Mapping of a Major Aluminum Tolerance Gene in Sorghum and Other Species in the Poaceae | first8 = LV | last8 = Kochian | first7 = L | last7 = Li | first6 = RE | last6 = Schaffert | first5 = PE | last5 = Klein | first4 = ME | last4 = Sorrells | first3 = Y | last3 = Wang | first2 = DF | last2 = Garvin |author = Magalhaes, J.

== Biodegradation ==
A Spanish scientific report from 2001 claimed that the fungus ''[[Geotrichum candidum]]'' consumes the aluminium in [[compact disc]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|title=Fungus 'eats' CDs|date=22 June 2001|publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/news010628-11|author=Bosch, Xavier |title=Fungus eats CD|date=27 June 2001|journal=Nature|doi-broken-date=2016-07-30|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2001/010627/full/news010628-11.html }}</ref> Other reports all refer back to the 2001 Spanish report and there is no supporting original research. Better documented, the bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' and the fungus ''[[Cladosporium]] resinae'' are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not AV gas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Bio19Tuat01-t1-body-d4.html|journal=Tuatara|title=Studies on the 'Kerosene Fungus' ''Cladosporium resinae'' (Lindau) De Vries: Part I. The Problem of Microbial Contamination of Aviation Fuels|page=29|author1=Sheridan, J. E. |author2=Nelson, Jan |author3=Tan, Y. L. |volume=19|issue=1}}</ref> However, these life forms do not directly attack or consume the aluminium; rather, the metal is corroded by microbe waste products.<ref>{{cite web |publisher = Duncan Aviation |title = Fuel System Contamination & Starvation |date=2011 |url = http://www.duncanaviation.aero/intelligence/201102/fuel_starvation_system_contamination.php}}</ref>
