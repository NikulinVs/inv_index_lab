Druyan herself had, at the time, rather vaporous standards of evidence for her many sundry beliefs (as she later acknowledged). She believed ... that Immanuel Velikovsky in the 1950s had correctly deduced the truth about the solar system. ... She believed in the ancient astronauts of Erich von Daniken.}}</ref>  Druyan freely acknowledged her past views and also said that they {{clarify|text=changed dramatically|date=August 2015}} after marrying [[Carl Sagan]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
