==History==

===Founding===

Jay Van Andel and Rich DeVos, friends since school days, had been business partners in various endeavors including a hamburger stand, air charter service, and a sailing business. In 1949 they were introduced by Neil Maaskant (Van Andel's second cousin) to the ''Nutrilite Products'' Corporation. [[Nutrilite]] was a California-based direct sales company founded by [[Carl Rehnborg]], developer of the first [[multivitamin]] marketed in the United States. In August 1949, after a night-long talk, DeVos and Van Andel signed up to become distributors for Nutrilite food supplements.<ref name="Conn">{{Cite book|last= Conn|first= Charles Paul|title= The Possible Dream: A Candid Look At Amway|authorlink=Charles Paul Conn|publisher=[[Revell]] |year= 1977 |isbn= 0-8007-0857-1}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} They sold their first box the next day for $19.50, but lost interest for the next two weeks. Shortly thereafter, at the urging of Maaskant, who had become their sponsor, they traveled to Chicago to attend a Nutrilite seminar. The meeting was at a downtown hotel, with over a hundred people in attendance. After seeing promotional filmstrips and listening to talks by company representatives and successful distributors, they decided to pursue the Nutrilite business opportunity with enthusiasm. They sold their second box of supplements on their return trip to Michigan, and rapidly proceeded to develop their new business further.<ref name="Conn" />{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

In 1949, DeVos and Van Andel had formed '''Ja-Ri Corporation''' (abbreviated from their respective first names) for importing wooden goods from South American countries. After their trip to the Nutrilite seminar, they dropped{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}<!---Sold?---> this business and Ja-Ri became their Nutrilite distributorship.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Van Andel|first= Jay|title= An Enterprising Life|authorlink=Jay Van Andel|publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |year= 1998 |isbn= 0-88730-997-6|pages=37–39}}</ref> In addition to profits on each product sold, Nutrilite also offered commission on the sales of products by new distributors introduced to the company by existing distributors—a system today known as [[multi-level marketing]] or [[network marketing]]. By 1958, DeVos and Van Andel had built an organization of over 5,000 distributors. However, following concerns about the stability of Nutrilite, in April 1959 they and some of their top distributors formed ''The American Way Association'' to represent the distributors and look for additional products to market.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Robinson|first= James W.|title= Empire of Freedom: The Amway Story and What It Means to You|publisher=[[Prima Publishing]] |year= 1997 |isbn= 0-7615-1088-5|page=11}}</ref>

Their first product was called Frisk, a concentrated organic cleaner developed by a scientist in Ohio. DeVos and Van Andel bought the rights to manufacture and distribute Frisk, and later changed the name to LOC (Liquid Organic Cleaner).<ref>{{cite video

===International expansion===
Amway expanded overseas to Australia in 1971, to Europe in 1973, to parts of Asia in 1974, to Japan in 1979, to Latin America in 1985, to Thailand in 1987, to China in 1995, to Africa in 1997, to India and Scandinavia in 1998, to Ukraine in 2003, to Russia in 2005, and to Vietnam in 2006.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Quixtar===
{{Main article|Amway Global}}
In 1999 the founders of the Amway corporation established a new holding company, named [[Alticor]], and launched three new companies: a sister (and separate) Internet-focused company named [[Quixtar]], [[Access Business Group]], and Pyxis Innovations. Pyxis, later replaced by [[Fulton Innovation]], pursued research and development and [[Access Business Group]] handled manufacturing and logistics for Amway, Quixtar, and third-party clients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2007706130458 |title=Amway marque to be revived; Quixtar label scrapped |publisher=The Detroit News |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>

The main difference was that all "Independent Business Owners" (IBO) could order directly from Amway on the Internet, rather than from their [[upline]] "direct distributor", and have products shipped directly to their home. The Amway name continued being used in the rest of the world. After virtually all Amway distributors in North America switched to Quixtar, Alticor elected to close Amway North America after 2001. In June 2007 it was announced that the Quixtar brand would be phased out over an 18- to 24-month period in favor of a unified Amway brand ([[Amway Global]]) worldwide.

In 2006, Quixtar published ''The Quixtar Independent Business Owner Compensation Plan'', in which the company reported that the average monthly gross income for "Active" IBOs was $115.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quixtar.com/documents/iwov/vis/010-en/pdf/IBO%20Support/BusForms/SA4400.pdf |title=Quixtar.com |format=PDF |accessdate=July 9, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110715140756/http://www.quixtar.com/documents/iwov/vis/010-en/pdf/IBO%20Support/BusForms/SA4400.pdf| archivedate= July 15, 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Global markets==
According to the Amway website, {{as of|2011|lc=y}} the company operates in over 100 countries and territories, organized into regional markets: the Americas, Europe, greater China, Japan and Korea, and SE Asia/Australia. The top 10 markets for Amway in 2015 were China, South Korea, United States, Japan, Thailand, Russia, Taiwan, Malaysia, India and Ukraine.<ref name="sales2015" />

In 2008, Alticor announced that two-thirds of the company's 58 markets reported sales increases, including strong growth in the China, Russia, Ukraine and India markets.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS173002+05-Feb-2009+PRN20090205 |title=Amway Parent hits 50th year running recording 15% sales growth |agency=Reuters  |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |date=February 5, 2009}}</ref>

===Amway China===
Amway grew quickly in China from its market launch in 1995. In 1998, after abuses of illegal [[pyramid scheme]]s led to riots, the Chinese government enacted a ban on all [[direct selling]] companies, including Amway.<ref>"Chinese officials ban direct marketing", April 22, 1998 ''[[Associated Press]]'', The Associated Press</ref> After the negotiations, some companies like Amway, [[Avon Products, Inc.|Avon]], and [[Mary Kay]] continued to operate through a network of retail stores promoted by an independent sales force.<ref>"Once-barred Amway becomes booming business in China", Leslie Chang, March 12, 2003,  ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''</ref> China introduced new direct selling laws in December 2005, and in December 2006 Amway was one of the first companies to receive a license to resume direct sales. However, the law forbids teachers, doctors, and civil servants from becoming direct sales agents for the company and, unlike in the United States, salespeople in China are ineligible to receive commissions from sales made by the distributors they recruit.

In 2006, Amway China had a reported 180,000 sales representatives, 140 stores, and $2&nbsp;billion in annual sales.<ref>[http://www.mlive.com/business/kzgazette/index.ssf?/base/business-3/116693763565130.xml&coll=7 "Amway, Mary Kay get long-awaited direct-selling licenses in China"] Rob Kirkbride, December 24, 2006, ''[[Kalamazoo Gazette]]''</ref> In 2007 Amway Greater China and South-east Asia Chief Executive Eva Cheng was ranked No.88 by ''Forbes'' magazine in its list of the World's Most Powerful Women.<ref name="ForbesWomen">{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/11/biz_powerwomen08_Eva-Cheng_34MT.html |title=Forbes' The 100 Most Powerful Women; No.88 Eva Cheng |work=Forbes |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |date=August 27, 2008}}</ref> In 2008, China was Amway's largest market, reporting 28% growth and sales of 17&nbsp;billion yuan(US$2.5 billion).<ref name=LevinD>{{cite news|last=Levin |first=Dan |title=Amway's China Redux |url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2009/0907/companies-sales-amway-china-redux.html |accessdate=17 May 2011 |newspaper=[[Forbes]] |date=August 27, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829074138/http://www.forbes.com/global/2009/0907/companies-sales-amway-china-redux.html |archivedate=29 August 2009 }}</ref> According to a report in Bloomberg Businessweek in April 2010, Amway had 237 retail shops in China, 160,000 direct sales agents, and $3&nbsp;billion in revenue.<ref name=EinhornB>{{cite news|last=Einhorn|first=Bruce|title=Why Amway and China are a Good Fit|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_16/b4174064710167.htm|accessdate=June 16, 2011|newspaper=[[Businessweek]]|date=April 8, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606102312/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_16/b4174064710167.htm| archivedate= June 6, 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Brands==
Amway's product line grew from LOC, with the laundry detergent SA8 added in 1960, and later the hair care product Satinique (1965) and the cosmetics line [[Artistry (cosmetics)|Artistry]] (1968). Today Amway manufactures over 450 products, with manufacturing facilities in China, India and the United States, as well as Nutrilite organic farms in [[Brazil]], Mexico and the United States (California and [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]).

Beauty and personal care products represented 25 percent of sales while durable products, such as eSpring water treatment systems and Atmosphere air treatment systems, represented 16 percent of sales. Home care products generated 7 percent of sales.<ref name="sales2015" />

According to [[Euromonitor International]], Amway sells more products with a satisfaction guarantee than any other direct seller.<ref name="euromonitor-amway-claims">{{cite web|title=Amway Claims|url=http://www.euromonitor.com/amway-claims|website=www.euromonitor.com|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>

===Household cleaners===
Amway is best known in North America for its original multi-purpose cleaning product LOC, SA8 laundry detergent, and Dish Drops dishwashing liquid. In the January 2007 issue of ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', SA8 with Bioquest was rated the best-performing laundry detergent, scoring 99 out of a possible 100 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/cooking-cleaning/laundry-detergents-1-07/overview/0107_soap_ov.htm |title=Laundry Detergents |publisher=Consumer Reports |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> ''Consumer Reports'' did, however, criticize SA8's pricing, a situation which was disputed by Amway.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Rob Kirkbride / The Grand Rapids Press|title=Amway's old reliable cleans up|publisher=Grand Rapids Press, The (MI)|page=A1 |date= December 12, 2006}}</ref> Consumer Reports conducted blind testing of detergents in 2010 and ranked versions of Amway's Legacy of Clean detergents 9th and 18th of 20 detergents tested.

==Ditto Delivery==
Alticor owns a patent on the online shopping method of Ditto Delivery, which allows consumers to specify an automatic monthly delivery of each product.<ref>{{US patent|7359871}}</ref> In May 2001, Ditto Delivery accounted for 30% of Quixtar's North American sales.<ref name=forbes2001>{{cite news|last=Bannan|first=Karen J|title=Amway.com |url=http://www.forbes.com/best/2001/0625/040.html |accessdate=May 17, 2011|work=[[Forbes]]|date=June 25, 2001}}</ref>

==Business model==
Amway combines direct selling with a [[multi-level marketing]] strategy. Amway distributors, referred to as "independent business owners" (IBOs), may market products directly to potential customers and may also sponsor and mentor other people to become IBOs. IBOs may earn income both from the retail markup on any products they sell personally, plus a performance bonus based on the sales volume they and their downline (IBOs they have sponsored) have generated.<ref name="Xardel"/> People may also register as IBOs to buy products at discounted prices.

[[Harvard Business School]], which described Amway as "one of the most profitable direct selling companies in the world", noted that Amway founders Van Andel and DeVos "accomplished their success through the use of an elaborate pyramid-like distribution system in which independent distributors of Amway products received a percentage of the merchandise they sold and also a percentage of the merchandise sold by recruited distributors".<ref name="HarvardBS">{{cite news|title=American Business Leaders of the Twentieth Century – Richard M.

==Commercial sponsorships==

In December 2006, Alticor secured the [[naming rights]] for the [[Orlando Magic]]'s home basketball arena in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida. The Orlando Magic are owned by the DeVos family. The arena, formerly known as the TD Waterhouse Centre, was renamed  the [[Amway Arena]].

==Politics and culture==

===Political contributions===
In the 1990s, the Amway organization was a major contributor to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (GOP) and to the election campaigns of various GOP candidates. Amway and its sales force contributed a substantial amount (up to half) of the total funds ($669,525) for the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1994|1994 political campaign]] of Republican congresswoman and Amway distributor [[Sue Myrick]] (N.C.).<ref name=burstein>{{cite web| title = She Did it Amway | author=Rachel Burstein | magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]| date = September–October 1996 | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/1996/09/she-did-it-amway| accessdate =May 11, 2011}}</ref> According to two reports by ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine, Amway distributor Dexter Yager "used the company's extensive voice-mail system to rally hundreds of Amway distributors into giving a total of $295,871" to Myrick's campaign.<ref name=burstein/><ref name=zibrowski>{{cite web| title = Tough sell| author=John Zibrowski, Jenna Ziman | magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]| date = Nov–Dec 1998 | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/1998/11/tough-sell| accessdate =May 11, 2011}}</ref> According to a campaign staffer quoted by the magazine, Myrick had appeared regularly on the Amway circuit, speaking at hundreds of rallies and selling $5 and $10 audiotapes.<ref name=burstein/> Following the 1994 election, Myrick maintained "close ties to Amway and Yager", and raised $100,000 from Amway sources, "most notably through fundraisers at the homes of big distributors", in the 1997–98 election cycle.<ref name=zibrowski/>

In October 1994, Amway gave the biggest corporate contribution recorded to that date to a political party for a single election, $2.5&nbsp;million to the [[Republican National Committee]], and was the number one corporate political donor in the United States.<ref name=burstein/> In the [[2004 Elections|2004 election cycle]], the organization contributed a total of $4 million to a conservative [[527 group]], [[Progress for America]].<ref>From opensecrets.org: [http://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail.asp?ein=201170395&cycle=2004&format=&tname=Progress+for+America Progress for America – Top Contributors, 2004 Cycle]</ref>

In July 1996, Amway co-founder Richard DeVos was honored at a $3&nbsp;million fundraiser for the Republican Party, and a week later, it was reported that Amway had tried to donate $1.3&nbsp;million to pay for Republican "infomercials" and televising of the GOP convention on [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Family Channel]], but backed off when Democrats criticized the donation as a ploy to avoid campaign-finance restrictions.<ref name=burstein/><ref name=vlasic>{{Cite news | last = Vlasic | first = Bill  |author2=Mary Beth Regan | title = Amway II: The Kids take over |work=BusinessWeek   | date = February 16, 1998 | url = http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1998/b3565099.arc.htm?chan=search  | accessdate =May 9, 2011 }}</ref>

In April 1997 Richard DeVos and his wife, Helen, gave $1&nbsp;million to the Republican National Committee (RNC),<ref name=zibrowski/><ref name=vlasic/> which at the time was the second-largest [[Campaign finance in the United States|soft-money]] donation ever, behind Amway's 1994 gift of $2.5&nbsp;million to the RNC.<ref name=zibrowski/> In July 1997, [[Senate Majority Leader|Senate Majority leader]] [[Trent Lott]] and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]] slipped a last-minute provision into a hotly contested compromise tax bill that granted Amway a tax break on its Asian branches, saving it $19&nbsp;million.<ref name=zibrowski/>

On December 18, 2012, the court ruled that film can be screened, but the makers have to remove "untrue information", as the screen near the end of the movie stated that 30% of company income is generated by sales of training materials and that the vast majority of its profits are shared only by the tiny fraction of top distributors.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrzej Biernat, poseł PO o zachowaniu Jarosława Gowina |url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114871,13073248,Koniec_procesu_ws__Amway__TVP_moze_pokazac_film__ale.html#BoxWiadTxt?lokale=wroclaw |title=Wiadomości - Gazeta.pl |language=pl |publisher=Wiadomosci.gazeta.pl |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref> This is not the only court case, so the film is still banned on other grounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114883,13074755,Rezyser_filmu_o_Amwayu_szczerze_o_wyroku__Nikt_nic.html#BoxWiadTxt?lokale=wroclaw |title=Reżyser filmu o Amwayu szczerze o wyroku: Nikt nic nie rozumie, czyli 'Witajcie w życiu' [WYWIAD&#93; |language=pl |publisher=Wiadomosci.gazeta.pl |date=2012-12-18 |accessdate=2013-05-27}}</ref>

===Dr. Phil and Shape Up===
In March 2004, TV personality [[Phil McGraw]] (a.k.a. Dr. Phil) pulled his "Shape Up" line of supplements off the market in the face of an investigation by the [[U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC). The supplements were manufactured by CSA Nutraceuticals, a [[subsidiary]] of [[Alticor]]'s Access Business Group.<ref name=Dembling>{{cite book|last= Sophia Dembling and Lisa Gutierrez|title=The making of Dr. Phil: the straight-talking true story of everyone's|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=|page=181|url=}}</ref> The FTC later dropped the probe, but in October 2005 a [[class-action lawsuit]] was filed against McGraw by several people who used the products and claimed that the supplements, which cost $120 per month, did not stimulate weight loss.<ref name="ctv">{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051007/drphil_classaction_051007/20051007/|title=Class-action status sought in Dr. Phil diet suit|accessdate=October 21, 2007|publisher=CTV Globe Media|year=2005|author=CTV.ca News Staff}}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In September 2006, a $10.5&nbsp;million settlement was reached, in which Alticor agreed to provide $4.5&nbsp;million in cash and $6&nbsp;million in Nutrilite products to disgruntled users of Shape Up.<ref name="usaap">{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-09-26-dr-phil-diet_x.htm|title=Settlement reached on Dr. Phil diet plan|accessdate=October 21, 2007|publisher=[[USA Today]] – [[Associated Press]]|agency=Associated Press | date=September 26, 2006}}</ref><ref>http://www.casewatch.org/civil/drphil/settlement.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=9791 |title=News+Views: Slimming the Amway |newspaper=Metro Times |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2005-10-04/justice/dr.phil_1_low-calorie-diet-dieters-class-action?_s=PM:LAW |publisher=CNN | title=California judge gives tentative OK to Toyota class-action suit | date=November 19, 2010}}</ref>

===Procter & Gamble===
Some Amway distributors distributed an [[urban legend]] that the (old) [[Procter & Gamble#Logo myth|Procter & Gamble service mark]] was in fact a [[Satanism|Satanic]] symbol or that the CEO of P&G is himself a practicing [[Satanist]]. (In some variants of the story, it is also claimed that the CEO of Procter & Gamble donated "satanic tithes" to the [[Church of Satan]].)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/alliance/procter.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Procter and Gamble and Satanism Rumor |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> Procter & Gamble alleged that several Amway distributors were behind a resurgence of the story in the 1990s and sued several independent Amway distributors and the company for [[defamation]] and slander.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=[[Procter & Gamble]] v.

==Other issues==

===Cultism===
Some Amway distributor groups have been accused of using "[[cult]]-like" tactics to attract new distributors and keep them involved and committed.<ref name=butterfield/><ref name="samways">''Dangerous persuaders'' by [[Louise Samways]].

In 2004, ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' featured a critical report based on a yearlong undercover investigation of business practices of Quixtar.<ref name="DATELINE">{{Cite news

  | accessdate =July 5, 2007 }}</ref> The report noted that the average distributor makes only about $1,400 per year and that many of the "high level distributors singing the praises of Quixtar" are actually "making most of their money by selling motivational books, tapes and seminars; not Quixtar's cosmetics, soaps, and electronics".
<blockquote>"In fact, about twenty high level distributors are part of an exclusive club; one that those hundreds of thousands of other distributors don’t get to join. For years only a privileged few, including Bill Britt, have run hugely profitable businesses selling all those books, tapes and seminars; things the rank and file distributors can’t sell themselves but, are told over and over again, they need to buy in order to succeed."</blockquote>
The program said that a Quixtar recruiter featured in the report made misleading and inconsistent statements about Quixtar earnings during a recruitment meeting and had an outstanding [[arrest warrant]] for cocaine possession from the mid-90s.<ref name=DATELINE/>

In a response to the ''Dateline'' report, Quixtar published a "Dateline Quixtar Response" on its official website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quixtar.com/ |title=Quixtar - Official Quixtar Company Site of Quixtar.com, Inc|accessdate=March 26, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022081856/http://www.quixtar.com/|archivedate=October 22, 2004 |website=quixtar.com}}</ref> In its response,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quixtar.com/ |title=Quixtar - Dateline Quixtar Response to NBC Dateline Quixtar Story|accessdate=March 26, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041029002502/http://www.quixtarresponse.com/|archivedate=October 29, 2004 |website=quixtarresponse.com}}</ref> Quixtar, among others, stated:
<blockquote>"We learned that two Dateline producers had registered as IBOs and for months had been conducting undercover research for the story, which included using a hidden camera to videotape meetings and conversations with IBOs. The producers did not identify themselves as working for Dateline, instead feigning interest in building a business powered by Quixtar."</blockquote>
The site also stated that:
<blockquote>"Dateline's story on Quixtar boiled down to the complaints of three former Independent Business Owners (IBOs) – one of whom is a competitor – and ignored the hundreds of thousands of IBOs powered by Quixtar who are achieving their goals."</blockquote>
