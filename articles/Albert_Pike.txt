'''Albert Pike''' (December 29, 1809 – April 2, 1891) was an attorney, soldier, writer, and [[Freemason]]. Albert Pike is the only Confederate military officer with an outdoor statue in Washington, D.C.

==Early life==
Pike was born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], the son of Ben and Sarah (Andrews) Pike, and spent his childhood in [[Byfield, Massachusetts|Byfield]] and [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]]. His colonial ancestors settled the area in 1635,<ref name=mscacw/> and included [[John Pike (settler)|John Pike]] (1613–1688/1689), the founder of [[Woodbridge, New Jersey]].<ref>Albert's descent from his immigrant ancestor John Pike is as follows: John Pike (1572–1654); John Pike (1613–1688/89); Joseph Pike (1638–1694); Thomas Pike (1682–1753/4); John Pike (1710–1755); Thomas Pike (1739–1836); Benjamin Pike (1780–?); Albert Pike (1809–1891).</ref> He attended school in Newburyport and [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]] until he was 15. In August 1825, he passed entrance exams at [[Harvard University]], though when the college requested payment of tuition fees for the first two years he chose not to attend. He began a program of self-education, later becoming a schoolteacher in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]], [[Bedford, Massachusetts|North Bedford]], [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts|Fairhaven]] and Newburyport.<ref>Hubbell, Jay B. (1954) ''The South in American Literature: 1607–1900''. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press. p. 640.</ref>

Pike was an imposing figure; six feet tall and 300 pounds with hair that reached his shoulders and a long beard.<ref name=smithassoc>[http://civilwarstudies.org/articles/Vol_5/pike.shtm "Albert Pike - Hero or Scoundrel?", ''The Smithsonian Associates Civil War E-Mail Newsletter'', Volume 5, Number 1, Civil War Studies.org, Smithsonian Associates]</ref><ref name=Cutrer/> In 1831, he left Massachusetts to travel west, first stopping in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and later moving on to [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. There he joined an expedition to [[Taos, New Mexico]], hunting and trading.<ref name=mscacw/> During the excursion his horse broke and ran, forcing Pike to walk the remaining 500 miles to Taos. After this he joined a trapping expedition to the [[Llano Estacado]] in New Mexico and Texas. Trapping was minimal and, after traveling about 1,300 miles (650 on foot), he finally arrived at [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]].<ref name=Cutrer>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpi18 Cutrer, Thomas W., "Pike, Albert", ''The Handbook of Texas'', Texas State Historical Association]</ref>

==Journalist and lawyer==
[[File:Albert Pike CDV.jpg|thumb|left|Signed ''Carte de visite'']]
Settling in Arkansas in 1833, Pike taught in a school and wrote a series of articles for the [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] ''Arkansas Advocate'' under the pen name of "Casca."<ref name=moneyhon/> The articles were popular enough that he was asked to join the newspaper's staff. After marrying Mary Ann Hamilton in 1834, he purchased the newspaper.<ref name=ipw>[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=PI006 Westmoreland, Ingrid P., "Pike, Albert", Oklahoma Historical Society]</ref> Under Pike's administration the ''Advocate'' promoted the viewpoint of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in a politically volatile and divided Arkansas December 1832.<ref name=moneyhon/>

He was the first reporter for the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] and also wrote a book (published anonymously), titled ''The Arkansas Form Book'', which was a guidebook for lawyers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Pike then began to study law and was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] in 1837, selling the ''Advocate'' the same year. He also made several contacts among the Native American tribes in the area. He specialized in claims on behalf of Native Americans against the federal government.<ref name=smithassoc/> In 1852 he represented [[Muscogee|Creek Nation]] before the Supreme Court in a claim regarding ceded tribal land. In 1854 he advocated for the [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]] although compensation later awarded to the tribes in 1856 and 1857 was insufficient.<ref name=ipw/> These relationships were to influence the course of his Civil War service.

Additionally, Pike wrote on several legal subjects and continued producing poetry, a hobby he had begun in his youth in Massachusetts. His poems were highly regarded in his day, but are now mostly forgotten. Several volumes of his works were privately published posthumously by his daughter.  In 1859, he received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Harvard.<ref>"The Phoenix," Manly P. Hall</ref>

==Military career==

===Mexican-American War===
When the [[Mexican–American War]] started, Pike joined the Regiment of Arkansas Mounted Volunteers (a cavalry regiment) and was commissioned as a troop commander with the rank of captain in June 1846.  With his regiment, he fought in the [[Battle of Buena Vista]]. Pike was discharged in June 1847.  He and his commander, Colonel [[John Selden Roane]], had several differences of opinion. This situation led finally to an "inconclusive" [[duel]] between Pike and Roane on July 29, 1847 near Fort Smith, Arkansas.<ref name="Eicher429">Eicher, John H., aer (2001) ''Civil War High Commands.'' Stanford: Stanford University Press. ISBN 0-8047-3641-3. p. 429</ref> Although several shots were fired in the duel, nobody was injured, and the two were persuaded by their seconds to discontinue it.<ref name=allsopp>[https://books.google.com/books?id=q84UAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=albert+pike&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjEjrGuwp7NAhVBTFIKHZwVB9UQ6AEIPDAG#v=onepage&q=albert%20pike&f=false Allsopp, Frederick William. ''A Life of Albert Pike'', Parke-Harper news service, 1920]</ref> 

After the war, Pike returned to the practice of law, moving to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] for a time beginning in 1853.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} He wrote another book, ''Maxims of the Roman Law and some of the Ancient French Law, as Expounded and Applied in Doctrine and Jurisprudence''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=A life of Albert Pike|last=Brown|first=Walter Lee|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|year=1997|isbn=1557284695|location=Fayetteville|pages=61, 240, 302, 408}}</ref> Although unpublished, this book increased his reputation among his associates in law. He returned to Arkansas in 1857, gaining some amount of prominence in the legal field and becoming an advocate of [[slavery]], although retaining his affiliation with the Whig Party.

In 1847 Pike became disillusioned when the Whig Party refused to take a stand on slavery. At the Southern Commercial Convention of 1854, Pike said the South should remain in the Union and seek equality with the North, but if the South "were forced into an inferior status, she would be better out of the Union than in it."<ref>Potter, David Morris and Edward, Don (1976) ''The impending crisis, 1848–1861''. HarperCollins. p. 467</ref> His anti-Catholicism stand led him to join the [[Know Nothing]] movement when it was organized in 1856, but was again disappointed when it refused to adopt a strong pro-slavery platform. He joined the other Southern delegates and walked out of the convention. His stand was that state's rights superseded national law and supported the idea of a Southern secession. This stand is made clear in his pamphlet of 1861, "State or Province, Bond or Free?"<ref name=moneyhon/>

===Civil War===
In 1861 Pike penned the lyrics to ''Dixie to Arms!''.<ref>[http://chnm.gmu.edu/loudountah/activities/pdf/DixieSongLyrics2.pdf "Dixie to Arms!", Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media, George Mason University]</ref> At the beginning of the war, Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to the Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated [[List of treaties of the Confederate States of America|several treaties]], one of the most important being with [[Cherokee]] chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], which was concluded in 1861.<ref name=smithassoc/>

Pike was commissioned as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] on November 22, 1861, and given a command in the [[Indian Territory]]. With Gen. [[Benjamin McCulloch|Ben McCulloch]], Pike trained three Confederate [[regiment]]s of [[Indian cavalry]], most of whom belonged to the "[[Five Civilized Tribes|civilized tribes]]", whose loyalty to the Confederacy was variable. Although initially victorious at the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] (Elkhorn Tavern) in March 1862,<ref name=mscacw>[http://www.ma150.org/day-by-day/1862-03-06/massachusetts-born-csa-general-albert-pike-leads-brigade-native-americans-batt  "Massachusetts born CSA general Albert Pike leads brigade of Native Americans at the Battle of Pea Ridge", Massachusetts Sesquicentennial Commission of the American Civil War]</ref> Pike's unit was defeated later in a counterattack, after falling into disarray. When Pike was ordered to send troops to Arkansas in May 1862, he resigned in protest.<ref name=ipw/> As in the previous war, Pike came into conflict with his superior officers, at one time drafting a letter to [[Jefferson Davis]] complaining about his direct superior.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bibliography of the Writings of Albert Pike: Prose, Poetry, Manuscript.|last=Boyden|first=William Llewellyn|publisher=A.A.S.C.|year=1921|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=18}}</ref>

After Pea Ridge, Pike was faced with charges that his troops had [[scalping|scalped]] soldiers in the field.<ref>Shea, William, and Earl Hess, Pea Ridge: Civil War Campaign in the West. University of North Carolina Press, 1992. ISBN 0-8078-4669-4.</ref> Maj. Gen. [[Thomas C. Hindman]] also charged Pike with mishandling of money and material, ordering his arrest.<ref name="Smith585">Smith, Dean E. (1986) "Pike, Albert" in ''Historical Times Illustrated History of the Civil War'', edited by Patricia L. Faust. New York: Harper & Row. ISBN 978-0-06-273116-6. p. 585</ref> Both these charges were later found to be considerably lacking in evidence; nevertheless Pike, facing arrest, escaped into the hills of Arkansas, sending his resignation from the Confederate Army on July 12.<ref name="Smith585"/> He was at length arrested on November 3 under charges of [[insubordination]] and [[treason]], and held briefly in [[Warren, Fannin County, Texas|Warren, Texas]], but his resignation was accepted on November 11 and he was allowed to return to Arkansas.<ref name="Smith585"/>

==Freemasonry==
{{Freemasonry}}
Pike first joined the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows]] in 1840, and he had then joined a [[Masonic Lodge]], where he became extremely active in the affairs of the organization, being elected Sovereign Grand Commander of the [[Scottish Rite]]'s Southern Jurisdiction in 1859.<ref name="Eicher429"/> He remained Sovereign Grand Commander for the remainder of his life (a total of thirty-two years), devoting a large amount of his time to developing the rituals of the order.<ref>Warner, Ezra J. (1959) ''Generals in Gray: Lives of the Confederate Commanders.'' Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press. ISBN 0-8071-0823-5. pp. 240–241</ref> Notably, he published a book called ''[[Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry]]'' in 1871, of which there were several subsequent editions. Pike stated that half of the text was copied from other works, but did not indicate his sources.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/mas/md/ ''Morals and Dogma'' at "Sacred Texts"]</ref>

==Death and legacy==
Pike died in Washington, D.C., at the age of 81, and was buried at [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Oak Hill Cemetery]].  Burial was against his wishes; he had left instructions for his body to be cremated.<ref name= hbtx>[http://www.dcmemorials.com/index_indiv0000360.htm PIKE, Brigadier General Albert: Memorial at the Municipal Center in Washington, D.C.]. dcmemorials.com</ref> In 1944, his remains were moved to the [[House of the Temple]], headquarters of the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite.  A [[Brigadier General Albert Pike|memorial to Pike]] is located in the [[Judiciary Square]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C.

The [[Albert Pike Memorial Temple]] is a historic Masonic lodge in Little Rock, Arkansas listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<ref>[http://www.littlerock.com/travel-tools/local-services/detail/historic-albert-pike-masonic-center "Historic Albert Pike Masonic Center", Little Rock Convention and Visitors Bureau]</ref>

==Poetry==
As a young man, Pike wrote poetry and he continued to do so for the rest of his life. At 23, he published his first poem, “Hymns to the Gods.” Later work was printed in literary journals like Blackwood’s ''Edinburgh Magazine'' and local newspapers. His first collection of poetry, ''Prose Sketches and Poems Written in the Western Country'', appeared in 1834.<ref name=Cutrer/> He later gathered many of his poems and republished them in ''Hymns to the Gods and Other Poems'' (1872). After his death these appeared again in ''Gen. Albert Pike’s Poems'' (1900) and ''Lyrics and Love Songs'' (1916).<ref name=moneyhon>
