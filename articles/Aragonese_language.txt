'''Aragonese''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|ə|ɡ|ɒ|ˈ|n|iː|z}}; ''aragonés'' {{IPA-esdia|aɾaɣoˈnes|}} in Aragonese) is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] spoken in several dialects by 10,000 to 30,000 people in the [[Pyrenees]] valleys of [[Aragon]], Spain, primarily in the [[Comarca#Spain|comarcas]] of [[Somontano de Barbastro]], [[Jacetania]], [[Alto Gállego]], [[Sobrarbe]], and [[Ribagorza/Ribagorça]]. It is the only modern language which survived from medieval [[Navarro-Aragonese]] in a form distinctly different from [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

Informally known as ''fabla'' ("talk" or "speech"), Aragonese is also commonly referred to by the names of its [[Aragonese language#Dialects|local dialects]] such as ''cheso'' (from [[Valle de Hecho]]) or ''patués'' (from the [[Benasque]] Valley).

==History==
Aragonese, which developed in portions of the [[Ebro]] basin, can be traced back to the [[High Middle Ages]]. It spread throughout the [[Pyrenees]] to areas where languages similar to [[Basque language|Basque]] were previously spoken. The [[Kingdom of Aragon]] (formed by the counties of Aragon, Sobrarbe and Ribagorza) expanded southward from the mountains, pushing the [[Moors]] farther south in the ''[[Reconquista]]'' and spreading the Aragonese language.

The union of the [[Catalonia|Catalan counties]] and the Kingdom of Aragon which formed the 12th-century [[Crown of Aragon]] did not merge the languages of the two territories; [[Catalan language|Catalan]] continued to be spoken in the east and [[Navarro-Aragonese]] in the west, with boundaries blurred by [[Dialect continuum|dialectal continuity]]. The Aragonese ''Reconquista'' in the south ended with the cession of [[Murcia]] by [[James I of Aragon]] to the [[Kingdom of Castile]] as dowry for an Aragonese princess.

The best-known proponent of the Aragonese language was [[Juan Fernández de Heredia|Johan Ferrandez d'Heredia]], the [[Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]] in [[Rhodes]] at the end of the 14th century. He wrote an extensive catalog of works in Aragonese and translated several works from Greek into Aragonese (the first in medieval Europe).

The spread of Castilian ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] origin of the [[House of Trastámara|Trastámara dynasty]], and the similarity between Castilian and Aragonese facilitated the recession of the latter. A turning point was the 15th-century coronation of the Castilian [[Ferdinand I of Aragon]], also known as Ferdinand of Antequeraa.

In recent times, Aragonese was mostly regarded as a group of rural dialects of Spanish. Compulsory education undermined its already weak position; for example, pupils were punished for using it. However, the 1978 [[Spanish transition to democracy]] heralded literary works and studies of the language.

===Modern Aragonese===
[[File:Grupos de parlas de l'aragonés.svg|270px|alt=Multicolored map of Aragon|thumb|Aragonese dialect map]]
Aragonese is the native language of the Aragonese mountain ranges of the Pyrenees, in the ''[[comarca]]s'' of Somontano, Jacetania, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza. Cities and towns in which Aragonese is spoken are [[Huesca]], [[Graus]], [[Monzón]], [[Barbastro]], [[Bielsa]], [[Gistaín|Chistén]], [[Fonz]], [[Echo, Aragón, Spain|Echo]], [[Estadilla]], [[Benasque]], [[Campo, Aragon|Campo]], [[Sabiñánigo]], [[Jaca]], [[Plan]], [[Ansó]], [[Ayerbe]], [[Broto]], and [[El Grado]].

It is spoken as a second language by inhabitants of [[Huesca]], [[Zaragoza]], [[Ejea de los Caballeros]], and [[Teruel]]. According to recent polls, there are about 10,000 active speakers and 30,000 [[Passive speakers (language)|passive speakers]].

In 2009, the [[Languages Act of Aragon]] recognized the "native language, original and historic" of [[Aragon]]. The language received several [[linguistic rights]], including its use in public administration.<ref>[http://www.boa.aragon.es/cgi-bin/BOAE/BRSCGI?CMD=VERDOC&BASE=BOLE&PIECE=BOLE&DOCR=3&SEC=FIRMA&RNG=200&SEPARADOR=&&PUBL=20091230  Languages Act of Aragon] Official Bulletin of Aragon</ref>

===Traits===
[[File:Linguistic map Southwestern Europe.gif|thumb|alt=Animated territorial map of Spain|Aragonese expanded into the territories of the Kingdom of Aragon from the 12th to the 16th centuries.]]
Aragonese has many historical traits in common with Catalan. Some are conservative features that are also shared with the [[Astur-Leonese languages]] and [[Galician-Portuguese]], where Spanish innovated in ways that did not spread to nearby languages.

====Shared with Catalan====
*Romance initial F- is preserved, e.g. FILIUM > {{lang|an|''fillo''}} ("son", Sp. {{lang|es|''hijo''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''fill''}}, Pt. {{lang|pt|''filho''}}).
*Romance [[palatal approximant]] (GE-, GI-, I-) consistently became medieval {{IPA|[dʒ]}}, as in medieval Catalan and Portuguese. This becomes modern ''ch'' {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, as a result of the devoicing of sibilants (see below). In Spanish, the medieval result was either {{IPA|[dʒ]}} (modern {{IPA|[x]}}), {{IPA|[ʝ]}} or nothing, depending on the context. E.g. IUVENEM > {{lang|an|''choven''}} ("young man", Sp. {{lang|es|''joven''}} {{IPA|/ˈxoβen/}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''jove''}} {{IPA|/ˈʒoβǝ/}}), GELARE > {{lang|an|''chelar''}} ("to freeze", Sp. {{lang|es|''helar''}} {{IPA|/eˈlaɾ/}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''gelar''}} {{IPA|/ʒǝˈla/}}).
*Romance groups -LT-, -CT- result in {{IPA|[jt]}}, e.g. FACTUM > {{lang|an|''feito''}} ("done", Sp. {{lang|es|''hecho''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''fet''}}, Gal./Port. {{lang|gl|''feito''}}), MULTUM > {{lang|an|''muito''}} ("many"/"much", Sp. {{lang|es|''mucho''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''molt''}}, Gal. {{lang|gl|''moito''}}, Port. {{lang|gl|''muito''}}).
*Romance groups -X-, -PS-, SCj- result in voiceless palatal fricative ''ix'' {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, e.g. COXU > {{lang|an|''coixo''}} ("crippled", Sp. {{lang|es|''cojo''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''coix''}}).
*Romance groups -Lj-, -C'L-, -T'L- result in palatal lateral ''ll'' {{IPA|[ʎ]}}, e.g. MULIERE > {{lang|an|''muller''}} ("woman", Sp. {{lang|es|''mujer''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''muller''}}), ACUT'LA > {{lang|an|''agulla''}} ("needle", Sp. {{lang|es|''aguja''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''agulla''}}).

====Shared with Catalan and Spanish====

*Open O, E from Romance result systematically in diphthongs {{IPA|[we]}}, {{IPA|[je]}}, e.g. VET'LA > {{lang|an|''viella''}} ("old woman", Sp. {{lang|es|''vieja''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''vella''}}). This includes before a palatal approximant, e.g. {{smallcaps|octō}} > {{lang|an|''ueito''}} ("eight", Sp. {{lang|es|''ocho''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''vuit''}}). Spanish diphthongizes except before yod, whereas Catalan ''only'' diphthongizes before yod.
*Loss of final unstressed -E but not -O, e.g. GRANDE > {{lang|an|''gran''}} ("big"), FACTUM > {{lang|an|''feito''}} ("done").  Catalan loses both -O and -E; Spanish preserves -O and sometimes -E.

====Shared with Spanish====

*Former voiced sibilants become voiceless ({{IPA|[z] > [s]}}, {{IPA|[dʒ] > [tʃ]}}).

====Shared with neither====

*Latin -B- is maintained in past imperfect endings of verbs of the second and third conjugations: {{lang|an|''teneba, teniba''}} ("he had", Sp. {{lang|es|''tenía''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''tenia''}}), {{lang|an|''dormiba''}} ("he was sleeping", Sp. {{lang|es|''dormía''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''dormia''}}).
*High Aragonese dialects (''alto aragonés'') and some dialects of [[Gascon language|Gascon]] have preserved the voicelessness of many intervocalic stop consonants, e.g. CLETAM > {{lang|an|''cleta''}} ("sheep hurdle", Cat. {{lang|ca|''cleda''}}, Fr. {{lang|fr|''claie''}}), CUCULLIATAM > ''cocullata'' ("crested lark", Sp. {{lang|es|''cogujada''}}, Cat. {{lang|ca|''cogullada''}}).
*Several Aragonese dialects maintain Latin {{smallcaps|-ll-}} as [[Gemination|geminate]] {{IPA|/ll/}}.

==Orthography==
In 2010, the [[Academia de l'Aragonés]] (founded in 2006) established an orthographic standard to modernize medieval [[orthography]] and to make it more etymological. The new orthography is used by the [[:an:|Aragonese Wikipedia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011074537/http://www.academiadelaragones.org/biblio/PROPUESTA%20ORTOGRAFICA%20ACAR%20(copia%20protechida%20ta%20referencia).pdf |title=Propuesta Ortografica de l'Academia de l'Aragonés |dead-url=yes |accessdate=July 2016}}{{dead link|date=July 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Aragonese had two orthographic standards:
* The ''grafía de Uesca'', codified in 1987 by the Consello d'a Fabla Aragonesa (CFA) at a convention in [[Huesca]], is used by most Aragonese writers. It has a more uniform system of assigning letters to phonemes, with less regard for etymology; words traditionally written with {{angbr|v}} and {{angbr|b}} are uniformly written with {{angbr|b}} in the Uesca system. Similarly, {{angbr|ch}}, {{angbr|j}}, and {{angbr|g}} before {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|i}} are all written {{angbr|ch}}. It uses letters associated with Spanish, such as {{angbr|[[ñ]]}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charrando.com/normasgraficas.pdf |title=Normas graficas de l'aragonés |accessdate=2008-10-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223602/http://www.charrando.com/normasgraficas.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}</ref>
* The ''grafía SLA'', devised in 2004 by the [[Sociedat de Lingüistica Aragonesa]] (SLA), is used by some Aragonese writers. It uses etymological forms which are closer to Catalan, Occitan, and medieval Aragonese sources. In the SLA system {{angbr|v}}, {{angbr|b}},{{angbr|ch}}, {{angbr|j}}, and {{angbr|g}} before {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|i}} are distinct, and the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] {{angbr|[[ny (digraph)|ny]]}} replaces {{angbr|ñ}}.

During the 16th century, Aragonese [[Morisco]]s wrote [[aljamiado]] texts (Romance texts in Arabic writing), possibly because of their inability to write in [[Arabic]]. The language in these texts has a mixture of Aragonese and Castilian traits, and they are among the last known written examples of the Aragonese formerly spoken in central and southern Aragon.<ref>[http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/26/50/097vespertino.pdf Aragonese in Aljamiado literature]</ref>

==Grammar==
Aragonese grammar is similar to that of other Iberian Romance languages, such as Spanish and [[Catalan language|Catalan]].

=== {{anchor|Definite article|Article}}Articles ===

The definite article in Aragonese has undergone dialect-related changes, with definite articles in Old Aragonese similar to their present Spanish equivalents. The most-widespread articles in Aragonese are similar to those in Galician and Portuguese, since they lack the initial ''l'':

{| class="wikitable"

===Lexicology===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Neighboring Romance languages have influenced Aragonese. Catalan and Occitan influenced Medieval Aragonese, and the Catalan influence continued under the [[Crown of Aragon]] in the [[Ribagorçan dialect]]. Since the 15th century, Spanish has most influenced Aragonese; it was adopted throughout Aragon as the first language, limiting Aragonese to the northern region surrounding the [[Pyrenees]]. [[French language|French]] has also influenced Aragonese; Italian loanwords have entered through other languages (such as Catalan), and Portuguese words have entered through Spanish. Germanic words came with the conquest of the region by Germanic peoples during the fifth century, and [[English language|English]] has introduced a number of new words into the language.

===Gender===
Words that were part of the [[Latin_declension#Second_declension_.28o_stems.29|Latin second declension]]—as well as words that joined it later on—are usually masculine:

* FILIU(M) > ''fillo'' (son)
* SCIURU + OLU(M) > ''esquiruelo'' ([[squirrel]])

Words that were part of the [[Latin_declension#First_declension_.28a_stems.29|Latin first declension]] are usually feminine:
* FILIA(M) > ''filla'' (daughter).

Some Latin neuter plural nouns joined the [[Latin_declension#First_declension_.28a_stems.29|first declension]] as singular feminine nouns: 
* FOLIA > ''fuella'' (leaf).

Words ending in ''-or'' are feminine:
* ''a honor'', ''a calor'', ''a color'', and (in Medieval Aragonese) ''la amor''

The names of fruit trees usually end in ''-era'' (a suffix derived from Latin -ARIA) and are usually feminine:
* ''a [[Pear|perera]]'', ''a [[Malus|manzanera]]'', ''a [[Juglans regia|nuquera]]'', ''a castanyera'', ''a tellera / o tilero'', ''a [[olive]]ra'', ''a [[Prunus avium|ciresera]]'', ''l'[[Almond|almendrera]]''

The genders of river names vary:

* Many ending in ''-a'' are feminine: ''a Cinca/a Cinga'', ''a Cinqueta'', ''a Garona'', ''L'Arba'', ''a Noguera'', ''a Isuela'', ''La Uecha'', ''La Uerva'', etc. The latter was known as ''río de la Uerba'' during the 16th century.
* Many from the second and the third declension are masculine: ''L'[[Ebro]]'', ''O [[Gállego (river)|Galligo]]'', ''O Flumen'', ''L'Alcanadre''.

===Pronouns===
Unlike most other Ibero-Romance varieties, Aragonese has [[partitive]] and [[locative case|locative]] [[clitic]] pronouns derived from the Latin ''inde'' and ''ibi'': ''en''/''ne'' and ''bi''/''i''/''ie''.

Such pronouns are present in most major Romance languages ([[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''en'' and ''hi'', [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ''ne'' and ''i'', French ''en'' and ''y'', and Italian ''ne'' and ''ci''/''vi'').

''En/ne'' is used for:
* Partitive objects: ''No n'he visto como aquello'' ("I haven't seen anything like that", literally 'Not (of it) I have seen like that').
* Partitive subjects: ''En fa tanto de mal'' ("It hurts so much", literally '(of it) it causes so much of pain')
* [[Ablative case|Ablatives]], places from which movements originate: ''Se'n va ra memoria'' ("Memory goes away", literally '(away from [the mind]) memory goes')

''Bi/i/ie'' is used for:
* Locatives, where something takes place: ''N'ibi heba uno'' ("There was one of them"), literally '(Of them) there was one')
* [[Allative case|Allative]]s, places that movements go towards or end: ''Vés-be'' ('Go there (imperative)')

==={{anchor|Early modern period literature}}Early modern period===
Since 1500, Spanish was the cultural language of Aragon; many Aragonese wrote in Spanish, and during the 17th century the Argensola brothers went to Castile to teach Spanish.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fSVKAAAAYAAJ&q=hermanos+argensola+ense%C3%B1ar+castellano&dq=hermanos+argensola+ense%C3%B1ar+castellano&hl=es&sa=X&ei=CEv0TrveDYyzhAfL4szDAQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg Alazet: revista de filología, Número 5]</ref>
Aragonese became a popular village language.<ref>[http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/26/50/097vespertino.pdf El aragonés de la  literatura aljamiado-morisca]</ref> During the 17th century, popular literature in the language began to appear. In a 1650 Huesca literary contest, Aragonese poems were submitted by Matías Pradas, Isabel de Rodas and "Fileno, montañés".{{cn|date=July 2016}}

===Contemporary literature===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
The 19th and 20th centuries have seen a renaissance of Aragonese literature in several dialects. In 1844, Braulio Foz' novel ''Vida de Pedro Saputo'' was published in the Almudévar (southern) dialect. The 20th century featured Domingo Miral's [[costumbrismo|costumbrist]] comedies and Veremundo Méndez Coarasa's poetry, both in Hecho (western) Aragonese; Cleto Torrodellas' poetry and Tonón de Baldomera's popular writings in the Graus (eastern) dialect and Arnal Cavero's costumbrist stories and Juana Coscujuela' novel ''A Lueca, historia d'una moceta d'o Semontano'', also in the [[Somontano de Barbastro|southern]] dialect.
