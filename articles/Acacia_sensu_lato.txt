'''''Acacia [[sensu lato|s.l.]]''''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|eɪ|ʃ|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|eɪ|s|i|ə}}), known commonly as '''mimosa''', '''acacia''', '''thorntree''' or '''wattle''',<ref name=carr>{{cite journal |last1=Carruthers |first1=Jane |last2=Robin |first2=Libby |title=Taxonomic imperialism in the battles for Acacia: Identity and science in South Africa and Australia |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa|date=February 2010 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=48–64 |doi=10.1080/00359191003652066 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00359191003652066 |accessdate=6 November 2015}}</ref> is a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] genus of shrubs and trees belonging to the [[subfamily]] [[Mimosoideae]] of the family [[Fabaceae]]. It was described by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1773 based on the [[Africa]]n species ''[[Acacia nilotica]]''. Many non-Australian species tend to be [[Thorns, spines and prickles|thorny]], whereas the majority of [[Australia]]n acacias are not. All species are [[Legume|pod]]-bearing, with sap and leaves often bearing large amounts of [[tannin]]s and [[condensed tannin]]s that historically found use as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.

The genus ''Acacia'' constitutes, in its traditional circumspection, the second largest genus in Fabaceae<ref name="thie">{{cite journal |last1=Thiele |first1=Kevin R. |last2=Fnk |first2=Vicki A. |last3=Iwatsuki |first3=Kunio |last4=Morat |first4=Philippe |last5=Peng |first5=Ching-I |last6=Raven |first6=Peter |last7=Sarukhán |first7=José |last8=Seberg |first8=Ole |title=The controversy over the retypification of Acacia Mill. with an Australian type: A pragmatic view |journal=Taxon |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=194–198 |issn=0040-0262 |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/historic/Congress/IBC_2011/Acacia_pragm.pdf |date=February 2011 |accessdate=6 November 2015}}</ref> (''[[Astragalus]]'' being the largest), with roughly 1,300 [[species]], about 960 of them native to Australia, with the remainder spread around the tropical to warm-[[temperate]] regions of both hemispheres, including [[Europe]], Africa, southern [[Asia]], and the [[Americas]] (see [[list of Acacia species|List of ''Acacia'' species]]). The genus was divided into five separate genera under the tribe "[[Acacieae]]". The genus now called ''[[Acacia]]'' represents the majority of the Australian species and a few native to southeast Asia, [[Réunion]], and [[Pacific Islands]]. Most of the species outside Australia, and a small number of Australian species, are classified into ''[[Vachellia]]'' and ''[[Senegalia]]''. The two final genera, ''[[Acaciella]]'' and ''[[Mariosousa]]'', each contain about a dozen species from the Americas (but see "[[#Classification|Classification]]" below for the ongoing debate concerning their taxonomy).

==Classification==
{{see also|List of Acacia species}}
English botanist and gardener [[Philip Miller]] adopted the name ''Acacia'' in 1754. The generic name is derived from {{lang|el|ἀκακία}} ({{transl|el|''akakia''}}), the name given by early Greek botanist-physician [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] (middle to late first century) to the medicinal tree ''[[Acacia nilotica|A.&nbsp;nilotica]]'' in his book ''[[Materia medica|Materia Medica]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Acacia-nilotica.htm |title=''Acacia nilotica'' (acacia) |work=Plants & Fungi |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |accessdate=28 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112043913/http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Acacia-nilotica.htm | archivedate= 12 January 2010 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl= no}}</ref> This name derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] word for its characteristic thorns, {{lang|el|ἀκίς}} ({{transl|el|''akis''}}; "thorn").<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esMPU5DHEGgC |first=Umberto |last=Quattrocchi |title=CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names |volume=1 A-C |year=2000 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8493-2675-2 |page=6}}</ref> The species name ''nilotica'' was given by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] from this tree's best-known range along the [[Nile]] river. This became the [[type species]] of the genus.

The traditional circumscription of ''Acacia'' eventually contained approximately 1,300 species. However, evidence began to accumulate that the genus as described was not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]]. Queensland botanist Les Pedley proposed the [[subgenus]] ''Phyllodineae'' be renamed ''Racosperma'' and published the binomial names.<ref name=maslin>{{cite book |last1=Maslin |first1=Bruce R.|title=Classification and phylogeny of ''Acacia''.

Eventually, consensus emerged that ''Acacia'' needed to be split as it was not monophyletic. This led to Australian botanists [[Bruce Maslin]] and Tony Orchard pushing for the retypification of the genus with an Australian species instead of the original African type species, an exception to traditional rules of priority that required ratification by the International Botanical Congress.<ref name=Smith>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/iapt/tax/2011/00000060/00000005/art00033 |author1=Gideon F.

In common parlance, the term "acacia" is occasionally applied to species of the genus ''[[Robinia]]'', which also belongs in the [[pea]] family. ''[[Robinia pseudoacacia]]'', an American species locally known as black locust, is sometimes called "false acacia" in [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and throughout Europe.

==Description==

[[File:Acacia facsiculifera seedling.jpg|thumb|''[[Acacia fasciculifera]]'' seedling in the transitional stage between pinnate leaves and phyllodes]]
The leaves of acacias are compound [[pinnate]] in general. In some species, however, more especially in the Australian and [[Pacific Islands]] species, the leaflets are suppressed, and the leaf-stalks ([[Petiole (botany)|petioles]]) become vertically flattened in order to serve the purpose of leaves. These are known as "[[phyllode]]s". The vertical orientation of the phyllodes protects them from intense sunlight since with their edges towards the sky and earth they do not intercept light as fully as horizontally placed leaves. A few species (such as ''[[Acacia glaucoptera]]'') lack leaves or phyllodes altogether but instead possess [[wikt:cladode|cladodes]], modified leaf-like [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] stems functioning as leaves.

The small flowers have five very small petals, almost hidden by the long [[stamens]], and are arranged in dense, globular or cylindrical clusters; they are yellow or cream-colored in most species, whitish in some, or even purple (''Acacia purpureopetala'') or red ([[Acacia leprosa 'Scarlet Blaze'|''Acacia leprosa'' 'Scarlet Blaze']]). ''Acacia'' flowers can be distinguished from those of a large related genus, ''[[Albizia]]'', by their stamens, which are not joined at the base. Also, unlike individual ''[[Mimosa]]'' flowers, those of ''Acacia'' have more than ten stamens.<ref>{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurcharan|title=Plant Systematics: An Integrated Approach|publisher=Science Publishers|year=2004|page=445|isbn=978-1-57808-351-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=In_Lv8iMt24C}}</ref>

The plants often bear spines, especially those species growing in arid regions. These sometimes represent branches that have become short, hard, and pungent, though they sometimes represent leaf-[[stipule]]s. ''[[Acacia armata]]'' is the kangaroo-thorn of Australia, and ''[[Acacia erioloba]]'' (syn. ''Acacia eriolobata'') is the camelthorn of Africa.

Acacia seeds can be difficult to germinate. Research has found that immersing the seeds in various temperatures (usually around 80&nbsp;°C (176&nbsp;°F)) and manual seed coat chipping can improve growth to around 80%.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=J Clemens |author2=PG Jones |author3=NH Gilbert |date=|year=1977|title=Effect of seed treatments on germination in Acacia|journal=Australian Journal of Botany |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=269–267 |pmid=|doi=10.1071/BT9770269|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/nid/65/paper/BT9770269.htm}}</ref>

==Symbiosis==

In the [[Central American]] bullthorn acacias—''[[Acacia sphaerocephala]]'', ''[[Acacia cornigera]]'' and ''[[Acacia collinsii]]'' — some of the spiny stipules are large, swollen and hollow. These afford shelter for several species of ''[[Pseudomyrmex]]'' ants, which feed on extra-floral nectaries on the leaf-stalk and small [[lipid]]-rich food-bodies at the tips of the leaflets called [[Beltian body|Beltian bodies]]. In return, the [[ant]]s add protection to the plant against [[herbivore]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Martin Heil |author2=Sabine Greiner |author3=Harald Meimberg |author4=Ralf Krüger |author5=Jean-Louis Noyer |author6=Günther Heubl |author7=K.

Other associated ant species appear to do nothing to benefit their hosts.

Similar mutualisms with ants occur on ''Acacia'' trees in Africa, such as the [[whistling thorn]] acacia. The acacias provide shelter for ants in similar swollen stipules and nectar in extrafloral nectaries for their symbiotic ants, such as ''Crematogaster mimosae''. In turn, the ants protect the plant by attacking large mammalian herbivores and stem-boring beetles that damage the plant.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Palmer|first=T.M.|author2=M.L. Stanton|author3=T.P.

The predominantly herbivorous spider ''[[Bagheera kiplingi]]'', which is found in Central America and Mexico, feeds on nubs at the tips of the acacia leaves, known as Beltian bodies, which contain high concentrations of protein. These nubs are produced by the acacia as part of a symbiotic relationship with certain species of ant, which also eat them.<ref>Meehan, Christopher J.; Olson, Eric J.; Curry, Robert L.

==Pests==
In Australia, ''Acacia'' species are sometimes used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of [[Hepialidae|hepialid]] [[moth]]s of the [[genus]] ''[[Aenetus]]'' including ''A.&nbsp;ligniveren''. These burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down. Other [[Lepidoptera]] larvae which have been recorded feeding on ''Acacia'' include [[brown-tail]], ''[[Endoclita|Endoclita malabaricus]]'' and [[turnip moth]]. The leaf-mining larvae of some [[Bucculatricidae|bucculatricid]] moths also feed on ''Acacia''; ''Bucculatrix agilis'' feeds exclusively on ''[[Acacia horrida]]'' and ''Bucculatrix flexuosa'' feeds exclusively on ''[[Acacia nilotica]]''.

Acacias contain a number of [[organic compound]]s that defend them from pests and grazing animals.<ref name="chem">{{cite web |url=http://uvalde.tamu.edu/pdf/chemtdaf.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515034950/http://uvalde.tamu.edu/pdf/chemtdaf.pdf |archivedate=May 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |title=Chemistry of Acacia's from South Texas |author1=T.

==Uses==

===Use as human food===
[[Image:Acacia dealbata seeds.jpg|thumb|''[[Acacia dealbata]]'' seeds]]

[[Acacia seed]]s are often used for food and a variety of other products.

In [[Burma]], [[Laos]], and [[Thailand]], the feathery shoots of ''Acacia pennata'' (common name ''cha-om'', ชะอม and ''su pout ywet'' in Burmese) are used in [[soups]], [[curries]], [[omelettes]], and [[stir-fries]].

===Gum===
Various species of acacia yield gum. True [[gum arabic]] is the product of ''[[Acaciia senegal]]'', abundant in dry tropical West Africa from [[Senegal]] to northern [[Nigeria]].

''[[Acacia nilotica]]'' (syn. ''Acacia arabica'') is the gum arabic tree of [[India]], but yields a gum inferior to the true gum arabic. Gum arabic is used in a wide variety of food products, including some soft drinks<ref name=test>{{cite web|url=https://www.wegmans.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10052&catalogId=1&productId=480288 |title=Powerade Ion4 Sports Drink, B Vitamin Enhanced, Strawberry Lemonade |publisher=Wegmans |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref> and confections.

The ancient Egyptians used acacia gum in paints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.ca/dp/product-description/0609803670 |title=Excerpt from A Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients: Fifth Edition (Paperback) Amazon.com |publisher=Amazon.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>
[[File:Acaciasap.jpg|thumb|Sap, from which gum can be made, oozing from an ''Acacia'' tree in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]]]
The gum of ''[[Acacia xanthophloea]]'' and ''[[Acacia karroo]]'' has a high sugar content and is sought out by the [[lesser bushbaby]]. ''Acacia karroo'' gum was once used for making confectionery and traded under the name "Cape Gum". It was also used medicinally to treat cattle suffering poisoning by ''[[Moraea]]'' species.<ref>http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantab/acaciakar.htm</ref>

===Uses in folk medicine===
''Acacia'' species have possible uses in [[folk medicine]]. A 19th-century Ethiopian medical text describes a potion made from an Ethiopian species (known as ''grar'') mixed with the root of the ''tacha'', then boiled, as a cure for [[rabies]].<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''An Introduction to the Medical History of Ethiopia'' (Trenton: Red Sea Press, 1990), p. 97</ref>

An [[astringent]] medicine high in [[tannin]]s, called [[catechu]] or cutch, is procured from several species, but more especially from ''[[Senegalia catechu]]'' (syn. ''Acacia catechu''), by boiling down the wood and evaporating the solution so as to get an extract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henriettesherbal.com/eclectic/usdisp/uncaria-gamb.html |title=An OCR'd version of the US Dispensatory by Remington and Wood, 1918 |publisher=Henriettesherbal.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/V8879E/v8879e05.htm |title=Cutch and catechu plant origin from the Food and Agriculture (FAO) department of the United Nations. Document repository accessed November 5, 2011}}</ref> The catechu extract from ''A. catechu'' figures in the history of chemistry in giving its name to the [[catechin]], [[catechol]], and [[catecholamine]] chemical families ultimately derived from it.

===Ornamental uses===
A few species are widely grown as ornamentals in gardens; the most popular perhaps is ''A. dealbata'' (silver wattle), with its attractive glaucous to silvery leaves and bright yellow flowers; it is erroneously known as "mimosa" in some areas where it is cultivated, through confusion with the related genus ''Mimosa''.

Another ornamental acacia is the [[Acacia xanthophloea|fever tree]]. Southern European florists use ''A. baileyana'', ''A. dealbata'', ''A. pycnantha'' and ''A. retinodes'' as cut flowers and the common name there for them is mimosa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewattle.com/schools/uses.php |title=World Wide Wattle |publisher=World Wide Wattle |date=2009-09-07 |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>

Ornamental species of acacias are also used by homeowners and [[landscape architect]]s for home security. The sharp thorns of some species are a deterrent to trespassing, and may prevent break-ins if planted under windows and near drainpipes. The aesthetic characteristics of acacia plants, in conjunction with their home security qualities, makes them a reasonable alternative to constructed fences and walls.

===Perfume===
[[File:Acaciafarnesiana1web.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Acacia farnesiana]]'']]
''[[Acacia farnesiana]]'' is used in the [[perfume]] industry due to its strong fragrance. The use of acacia as a fragrance dates back centuries.

===Symbolism and ritual===
[[File:Philae Temple Egypt Goddess Isis As Angel Mural Artwork 2004-10-11.jpg|thumb|upright|Egyptian goddess [[Isis]]]]

Acacia also supposed to have been used for Zulu warriors' iziQu (or isiKu) beads, which passed on through Sir [[Robert Baden-Powell]] to the Boy Scout movement's [[Wood Badge]] training award.

[[Egyptian mythology]] has associated the acacia tree with characteristics of the [[tree of life]], such as in the [[Myth of Osiris and Isis]].

Several parts (mainly bark, root, and resin) of ''Acacia'' species are used to make [[incense]] for rituals. Acacia is used in incense mainly in India, Nepal, and China including in its Tibet region. Smoke from acacia bark is thought to keep [[demon]]s and [[ghost]]s away and to put the gods in a good mood. Roots and resin from acacia are combined with [[rhododendron]], [[acorus]], [[cytisus]], [[salvia]], and some other components of incense. Both people and elephants like an alcoholic beverage made from acacia fruit.<ref name="fachforum">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080626102405/http://www.naturheilpraxis.de/exclusiv/nh-online/2005/nhp05/a_nh-ff02.html Naturheilpraxis Fachforum (German)]</ref>
According to Easton's Bible Dictionary, the acacia tree may be the “burning bush” ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 3:2) which [[Moses]] encountered in the desert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eastonsbibledictionary.com/b/bush.htm |title=Easton's Bible Dictionary: Bush |publisher=Eastonsbibledictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref> Also, when God gave Moses the instructions for building the [[Tabernacle]], he said to "make an ark" and "a table of acacia wood" (Exodus 25:10 & 23, [[Revised Standard Version]]). Also, in the Christian tradition, Christ's crown of thorns is thought to have been woven from acacia.<ref>Dictionary of Symbols.Chevalier and Gheerbrant. Penguin Reference.1996.</ref>

In [[Russia]], [[Italy]], and other countries, it is customary to present women with yellow mimosas (among other flowers) on [[International Women's Day]] (March 8). These "mimosas" may be from ''A. dealbata'' (silver wattle).

===Tannin===
The bark of various Australian species, known as wattles, is very rich in [[tannin]] and forms an important article of export; important species include ''[[Acacia pycnantha|A. pycnantha]]'' (golden wattle), ''[[Acacia decurrens|A. decurrens]]'' (tan wattle), ''A. dealbata'' (silver wattle) and ''A. mearnsii'' (black wattle).

Black wattle is grown in plantations in [[South Africa]] and [[South America]]. Most Australian ''Acacia'' species introduced to South Africa have become an enormous problem, due to their naturally aggressive propagation.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The pods of ''A. nilotica'' (under the name of ''neb-neb''), and of other African species, are also rich in tannin and used by [[Tanning (leather)|tanners]]. In [[Yemen]], the principal tannin substance was derived from the leaves of the salam-tree (''Acacia etbaica''), a tree known locally by the name ''qaraẓ'' (''garadh'').<ref>''R. Moss b.

===Wood===
[[File:Starr 030405-0092 Acacia koa.jpg|thumb|''[[Acacia koa]]'' wood]]
Some ''Acacia'' species are valuable as timber, such as ''A. melanoxylon'' (blackwood) from [[Australia]], which attains a great size; its wood is used for furniture, and takes a high polish; and ''A. omalophylla'' (myall wood, also Australian), which yields a fragrant timber used for ornaments. ''[[Acacia seyal|A. seyal]]'' is thought to be the [[shittah-tree]] of the [[Bible]], which supplied shittim-wood. According to the Book of Exodus, this was used in the construction of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. ''[[Acacia koa|A. koa]]'' from the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and ''[[Acacia heterophylla|A. heterophylla]]'' from [[Réunion]] are both excellent timber trees. Depending on abundance and regional culture, some ''Acacia'' species (e.g. ''A. fumosa'') are traditionally used locally as firewoods.<ref>{{cite web|author=Maugh, T.H.

===Pulpwood===
In [[Indonesia]] (mainly in [[Sumatra]]) and in [[Malaysia]] (mainly in [[Sabah]]), plantations of ''[[Acacia mangium|A. mangium]]'' are being established to supply [[pulpwood]] to the paper industry.

Acacia wood pulp gives high opacity and below average bulk [[paper]]. This is suitable in [[Woodfree uncoated paper|lightweight offset papers]] used for Bibles and dictionaries. It is also used in paper tissue where it improves softness.

===Land reclamation===
Acacias can be planted for erosion control, especially after mining or construction damage.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Barr, D. A. |author2=Atkinson, W. J.|date=|year=1970 |title=Stabilization of coastal sands after mining|journal=J. Soil Conserv. Serv. N.S.W. |volume=26 |issue= |pages=89–105. |pmid=|doi=|url=}}</ref>

==Ecological invasion==
For the same reasons it is favored as an erosion-control plant, with its easy spreading and resilience, some varieties of acacia are potentially invasive species. One of the most globally significant invasive acacias is black wattle ''A. mearnsii'', which is taking over grasslands and abandoned agricultural areas worldwide, especially in moderate coastal and island regions where mild climate promotes its spread. Australian/New Zealand Weed Risk Assessment gives it a "high risk, score of 15" rating and it is considered one of the world's 100 most invasive species.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hear.org/pier/species/acacia_mearnsii.htm |title=Acacia mearnsii (PIER species info) |publisher=Hear.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>
Extensive ecological studies should be performed before further introduction of acacia varieties, as this fast-growing genus, once introduced, spreads quickly and is extremely difficult to eradicate.

==Phytochemistry==

===Cyanogenic glycosides===
Nineteen different species of ''Acacia'' in the Americas contain [[glycoside|cyanogenic glycosides]], which, if exposed to an [[enzyme]] which specifically splits glycosides, can release [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN) in the "leaves".<ref>[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0038-4909%2819871209%2932%3A4%3C499%3ACGIAOM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z&size=LARGE&origin=JSTOR-enlargePage Cyanogenic Glycosides in Ant-Acacias of Mexico and Central America David S. Seigler, John E. Ebinger The Southwestern Naturalist, Vol. 32, No. 4 (December 9, 1987), pp. 499–503 ] {{doi|10.2307/3671484}}</ref> This sometimes results in the poisoning death of [[livestock]].

If fresh plant material spontaneously produces 200 ppm or more HCN, then it is potentially toxic. This corresponds to about 7.5 μmol HCN per gram of fresh plant material. It turns out that, if acacia "leaves" lack the specific glycoside-splitting enzyme, then they may be less toxic than otherwise, even those containing significant quantities of cyanic glycosides.<ref name="chemotaxonomie">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YpnboQBbw7EC&pg=PA336&lpg=PA336&dq=acacia+tryptamine |title=Chemotaxonomie der Pflanzen By Robert Hegnauer |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 1996-01-01|accessdate=2013-03-06|isbn=9783764351656}}</ref>

Some ''Acacia'' species containing cyanogens include ''[[Acacia erioloba]]'', ''A. cunninghamii'', ''A. obtusifolia'', ''A. sieberiana'', and ''A. sieberiana'' var. ''woodii''<ref name="juliflora">[http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/ad317e/AD317E05.htm FAO Kamal M.

==Famous acacias==
The [[Arbre du Ténéré]] in [[Niger]] was the most isolated tree in the world, about {{convert|400|km|0|abbr=on}} from any other tree. The tree was knocked down by a truck driver in 1973.<ref>[[Michael Palin]], ''Sahara'', Weidenfeld & Nicolson, ISBN 978-0-2978-6359-5</ref>

In [[Nairobi]], Kenya, the [[Stanley Hotel, Nairobi|Thorn Tree Café]] is named after a  Naivasha thorn tree (''Acacia xanthophloea'')<ref name="Hemsing1974">{{cite book|author=Jan Hemsing|title=Old Nairobi and the New Stanley Hotel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L3QMAQAAIAAJ|year=1974|publisher=Church, Raitt, and Associates|page=53}}</ref> in its centre. Travelers used to pin notes to others to the thorns of the tree. The current tree is the third of the same variety.
