===Reception===
In ''Movie - Film - Review'', ''[[Daily Mail]]'' staffer Christopher Tookey wrote that though the actresses were "competent in roles that may have some reference to their own careers", the film "is visually unimaginative, never escapes its stage origins, and is almost totally lacking in revelation or surprising incident".<ref name=Tookey/>  Noting that there were "occasional, refreshing moments of intergenerational bitchiness", they did not "justify comparisons to ''[[All About Eve]]''", and were "insufficiently different to deserve critical parallels with ''[[Rashomon]]''".<ref name=Tookey/> He also wrote that ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the film a "slow, stuffy chamber-piece", and that ''[[The Evening Standard]]'' stated the film's "best moments exhibit the bitchy tantrums seething beneath the threesome's composed veneers".<ref name=Tookey>{{cite web|last1=Tookey|first1=Chris|title=review: Actresses / Actrius / Actrices|url=http://www.movie-film-review.com/devFilm.asp?ID=12423|publisher=Movie - Film - Review|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref>  [[MRQE]] wrote "This cinematic adaptation of a theatrical work is true to the original, but does not stray far from a theatrical rendering of the story."<ref name=MRQE>{{cite web|last1=staff|title=Actrius (1997)|url=http://www.mrqe.com/movie_reviews/actrius-m100030469|publisher=[[MRQE]]|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref>
