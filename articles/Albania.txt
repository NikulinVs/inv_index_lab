== Etymology ==
''Albania'' is the [[Medieval Latin]] name of the country. The country is called ''Shqipëri'' by its people. The name may be derived from the [[Illyrian tribe]] of the Albani recorded by [[Ptolemy]], the geographer and astronomer from [[Alexandria]] who drafted a map in 150&nbsp;AD that shows the city of [[Albanopolis]] located northeast of [[Durrës]].<ref>Madrugearu A, Gordon M. The wars of the [[Balkan Peninsula]]. Rowman & Littlefield, 2007. p. 146.</ref><ref>{{Barrington|49 & notes}}</ref>

The name may have a continuation in the name of a medieval settlement called Albanon and Arbanon, although it is not certain that this was the same place.<ref>The Illyrians by J. J. Wilkes, 1992, ISBN 978-0-631-19807-9, page 279,"We cannot be certain that the Arbanon of Anna Comnena is the same as Albanopolis of the Albani, a place located on the map of Ptolemy (3.12)"</ref> In his ''History'' written in 1079–1080, the [[Byzantine]] historian [[Michael Attaliates]] was the first to refer to ''[[Albanoi]]'' as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]] in 1043 and to the ''Arbanitai'' as subjects of the Duke of [[Dyrrachium]].<ref>Robert Elsei. ''The Albanian lexicon of Dion Von Kirkman. Earliest reference to the existence of the Albanian language'', pp. 113–122.</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]], the Albanians called their country ''Arbëri'' or ''Arbëni'' and referred to themselves as [[Arbëresh]] or ''Arbënesh''.<ref>[http://www.pinocacozza.it/ Pinocacozza.it {{sq icon}}] {{it icon}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-arberesh.eu/|title=Radio-Arberesh.eu|author=Casanova|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>

As early as the 17th century the placename ''Shqipëria'' and the ethnic demonym ''Shqiptarë'' gradually replaced ''Arbëria'' and ''Arbëresh''. The two terms are [[folk etymology|popularly]] interpreted as "Land of the Eagles" and "Children of the Eagles".<ref>Kristo Frasheri. ''History of Albania (A Brief Overview)''. Tirana, 1964.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mirror.undp.org/albania/download/pdf/albanian.pdf|title=The Albanian Language|last=Lloshi|first=Xhevat|publisher=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main article|Illyrians|History of Albania|Origin of the Albanians}}
The history of Albania emerged from the [[Prehistory of Southeastern Europe|prehistoric stage]] from the 4th century BC, with early records of [[Illyria]] in [[Greco-Roman historiography]].in

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:Shpella e zeze - Pellumbas.jpg|thumb|right|Pellumbas Cave near the city of [[Tirana]]]]
The first traces of human presence in Albania, dating to the [[Middle Paleolithic]] and [[Upper Paleolithic]] eras, were found in the village of Xarrë, near [[Sarandë]] and [[Mount Dajt]] near [[Tiranë]].<ref name="Prendi">F. Prendi, "The Prehistory of Albania", ''The Cambridge Ancient History'', 2nd edn., vol. 3, part 1: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vXljf8JqmkoC&pg=PA187 The Prehistory of the Balkans; and the Middle East and the Aegean World, Tenth to Eighth Centuries B.C.]'', ed. John Boardman et al. (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1982), 189–90.</ref> The objects found in a cave near Xarrë include flint and jasper objects and fossilized animal bones, while those found at Mount Dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the [[Aurignacian culture]]. The Paleolithic finds of Albania show great similarities with objects of the same era found at Crvena Stijena in Montenegro and north-western Greece.<ref name="Prendi"/>

=== Antiquity ===
In ancient times, the territory of modern Albania was mainly inhabited by a number of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribes. This territory was known as [[Illyria]], corresponding roughly to the area east of the Adriatic sea to the mouth of the [[Vjosë]] river in the south.<ref>The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, ISBN 978-0-631-19807-9, page 92, "Appian's description of the Illyrian territories records a southern boundary with Chaonia and Thesprotia, where ancient Epirus began south of river Aoous (Vjose)"  [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C&lpg=PP1&dq=illyrians%20wilkes&pg=PR20 also map]</ref><ref>Cambridge University Press.

One of the most powerful tribes that ruled over modern Albania was the [[Ardiaei]]. The Ardiaen Kingdom reached its greatest extent under [[Agron of Illyria|Agron]], son of [[Pleuratus II]]. Agron extended his rule over other neighboring tribes as well.<ref>{{Cite book|title = A History of Macedonia: 336–167 B.C|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qpb3JdwuDQIC|publisher = Clarendon Press|date = 1 January 1972|isbn = 978-0-19-814815-9|first = Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière|last = Hammond|first2 = Frank William|last2 = Walbank}}</ref> After Agron's death in 230 BC, his wife Teuta inherited the&nbsp;Ardiaean kingdom.

After the creation of the kingdom, a Catholic political structure was a good basis for the papal plans of spreading Catholicism in the Balkans. This plan found also the support of [[Helen of Anjou]], a cousin of Charles of Anjou, who was at that time ruling territories in North Albania. Around 30 Catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule in North Albania and in Serbia.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Regnum Albaniae, the Papal Curia, and the Western Visions of a Borderline Nobility|last = Etleva|first = Lala|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2008|pages = |url = http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2009/mphlae01.pdf}}</ref> During 1331–55, the [[Serbian Empire]] wrestled control over Albania. After the dissolution of the Serbian Empire, several Albanian principalities were created, and among the most powerful were the Balsha, Thopia, Kastrioti, Muzaka and Arianiti. In the first half of the 14th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] invaded most of Albania. But in 1444, the Albanian principalities were united under [[Skanderbeg|George Castrioti Skanderbeg]], (Albanian: Gjergj Kastrioti, Skenderbeu) the national hero of Albania.

At the dawn of the establishment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Southeast Europe, the geopolitical landscape was marked by scattered kingdoms of small principalities. The Ottomans erected their garrisons throughout southern Albania by 1415 and occupied most of Albania by 1431.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Licursi |first=Emiddio Pietro|title=Empire of Nations: The Consolidation of Albanian and Turkish National Identities in the Late Ottoman Empire, 1878–1913 |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/72122169/7/Pashko-Vasa|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear=|year=2011 |publisher= Columbia University |location= New York |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |doi_inactivedate= |bibcode= |id=|page=19 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= By 1415, after a chaotic interregnum, Sultan Mehmet I sent the military to erect the first Ottoman garrisons throughout southern Albania, establishing direct military authority in the region&nbsp;... l jurisdiction over most of Albania&nbsp;...}}</ref> However, in 1443 a great and longstanding [[History of the Albanian-Turkish Wars|revolt broke]] out under the lead of the Albanian national hero [[Skanderbeg]], which lasted until 1479, many times defeating major [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] armies led by the sultans [[Murad II]] and [[Mehmed II]]. Skanderbeg united initially the Albanian princes, and later on established a centralized authority over most of the non-conquered territories, becoming the ruling Lord of Albania. He also tried relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to create a European coalition against the Ottomans. He thwarted every attempt by the Turks to regain Albania, which they envisioned as a springboard for the invasion of Italy and western Europe. His unequal fight against the mightiest power of the time won the esteem of Europe as well as some support in the form of money and military aid from Naples, the Papacy, Venice, and Ragusa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12472/Albania/42646/The-decline-of-Byzantium|title=Albania :: The decline of Byzantium |work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>
With the arrival of the Turks, Islam was introduced in Albania as a third religion. This conversion caused a massive emigration of Albanians to the Christian European countries.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gjonça, Arjan |title=Communism, Health and Lifestyle: The Paradox of Mortality Transition in Albania, 1950–1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKEal7FHClUC&pg=PA7|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-31586-2|pages=7–}}</ref>
Along with the [[Bosniaks]], Muslim Albanians occupied an outstanding position in the Ottoman Empire, and were the main pillars of Ottoman Porte's policy in the Balkans<ref name="referenceworks.brillonline">Clayer, Nathalie (2012).

Brill Online.</ref>

Enjoying this privileged position in the empire, Muslim Albanians held various high administrative positions, with over two dozen [[Grand Viziers]] of Albanian origin, such as Gen. [[Köprülü Mehmed Pasha]], who commanded the Ottoman forces during the [[Ottoman-Persian Wars]]; Gen. [[Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed]], who led the Ottoman armies during the [[Austro-Turkish War (1663–1664)|Austro-Turkish War]]; and, later, [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] of Egypt.<ref name=Arnawutlu>[http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/arnawutluk-COM_0065 "Arnawutluḳ."]  inE''ncyclopaedia of Islam'', Second Edition.

In the 15th century, when the Ottomans were gaining a firm foothold in the region, Albanian towns were organised into four principal [[sanjaks]]. The government fostered trade by settling a sizeable Jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in Spain (at the end of the 15th century). [[Vlorë]] saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from Europe such as velvets, cotton goods, mohairs, carpets, spices and leather from [[Bursa]] and [[Constantinople]]. [[File:Dupré - Ali Pasha.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Ali Pasha of Tepelena]] was notably one of the most powerful autonomous Muslim Albanian rulers, he ruled over the [[Pashalik of Yanina]], and even attempted to rival the [[Dey of Algiers]] in the seas.]] Some citizens of Vlorë even had business associates throughout Europe.<ref name=Arnawutlu/>

Albanians could also be found throughout the empire in Iraq, Egypt, Algeria and across the [[Maghreb]], as vital military and administrative retainers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norris|first=H.

The process of Islamization was an incremental one, commencing from the arrival of the Ottomans in the 14th century (to this day, a minority of Albanians are Catholic or Orthodox Christians, though the vast majority became Muslim). [[Timar]] holders, the bedrock of early Ottoman control in Southeast Europe, were not necessarily converts to Islam, and occasionally rebelled; the most famous of these rebels is [[Skanderbeg]] (his figure would rise up later on, in the 19th century, as a central component of the Albanian national identity). The most significant impact on the Albanians was the gradual Islamisation process of a large majority of the population, although it became widespread only in the 17th century.<ref name="referenceworks.brillonline"/>

Mainly [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] converted in the 17th century, while the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Albanians followed suit mainly in the following century. Initially confined to the main city centres of [[Elbasan]] and [[Shkoder]], by this period the countryside was also embracing the new religion. The motives for conversion according to some scholars were diverse, depending on the context. The lack of source material does not help when investigating such issues.<ref name="referenceworks.brillonline"/>

Albania remained under Ottoman control as part of the [[Rumelia]] province until 1912, when [[independent Albania]] was [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|declared]].

=== Era of nationalism and League of Prizren ===

[[File:Albanian vilayet.jpg|200px|thumb|Map outlining the [[Albanian Vilayet]] requested by the League of Prizren]]
The [[League of Prizren]] was formed on 1 June 1878, in [[Prizren]], [[Kosovo Vilayet]] of Ottoman Empire. At first the Ottoman authorities supported the League of Prizren, whose initial position was based on the religious solidarity of Muslim [[landlords]] and people connected with the [[Ottoman Porte|Ottoman administration]]. The Ottomans favoured and protected Muslim solidarity, and called for defense of Muslim lands, including present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. This was the reason for naming the league ''The Committee of the Real Muslims'' ({{lang-sq|Komiteti i Myslimanëve të Vërtetë}}).<ref>{{Citation |last=Kopecek |first=Michal |authorlink= |first2= Ahmed|last2= Ersoy|first3=Maciej|last3=Gorni |first4=Vangelis |last4= Kechriotis |first5= Boyan |last5= Manchev |first6= Balazs |last6= Trencsenyi |first7= Marius  |last7= Turda  |author-separator= |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title= Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770–1945)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=k5Vsjg508EYC&pg=PA349&dq=%22albanian+vilayet%22+%22Greater+albania%22#v=onepage&q&f=false|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 18 January 2011 |edition= |series= |volume= 1|year=2006 |publisher=Central European University Press |location= Budapest, Hungary|isbn=963-7326-52-9 |oclc= |doi= |doi_inactivedate= |bibcode=  |page= 348 |pages= |nopp= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= The position of the League in the beginning was based on religious solidarity.

The Ottomans cancelled their support when the League, under the influence of [[Abdyl Frashëri|Abdyl bey Frashëri]], became focused on working toward Albanian autonomy and requested merging of four Ottoman vilayets ([[Kosovo Vilayet|Kosovo]], [[Scutari Vilayet|Scutari]], [[Monastir Vilayet|Monastir]] and [[Janina Vilayet|Ioannina]]) into a new ''[[vilayet]]'' of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (the [[Albanian Vilayet]]). The League used military force to prevent the annexing areas of [[Plav Municipality|Plav]] and [[Gusinje]] assigned to Montenegro by the [[Congress of Berlin]]. After several successful battles with Montenegrin troops such as in [[Battle of Novšiće|Novsice]], under the pressure of the [[great powers]], the League of Prizren was forced to retreat from their contested regions of Plav and Gusinje and later on, the league was defeated by the Ottoman army sent by the Sultan.<ref name="League of Prizren">{{cite web|title=Albanian League|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12553/Albanian-League|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref>
The [[Albanian Revolt of 1912|Albanian uprising of 1912]], the Ottoman defeat in the [[Balkan Wars]] and the advance of Montenegrin, Serbian and Greek forces into territories claimed as Albanian, led to the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|proclamation of independence]] by [[Ismail Qemali]] in [[Vlora]], on 28 November 1912.

{{Main article|Albanian Republic|Kingdom of Albania (1928–39)}}
The short-lived [[Principality of Albania|principality]] (1914–1925) was succeeded by the first [[Albanian Republic]] (1925–1928). In 1925 the four-member Regency was abolished and [[Zog I of Albania|Ahmed Zogu]] was elected president of the newly declared republic. [[Tirana]] was endorsed officially as the country's permanent capital.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Albanians: A Modern History|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IzI0uOZ2j6gC|publisher = I.B.Tauris|date = 1 January 1999|isbn = 978-1-86064-541-9|first = Miranda|last = Vickers|page = 118}}</ref> Zogu led an authoritarian and conservative regime, the primary aim of which was the maintenance of stability and order. Zogu was forced to adopt a policy of cooperation with Italy. A pact had been signed between Italy and Albania on 20 January 1925 whereby Italy gained a monopoly on shipping and trade concessions.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = The Albanians: A Modern History|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IzI0uOZ2j6gC|publisher = I.B.Tauris|date = 1 January 1999|isbn = 978-1-86064-541-9|first = Miranda|last = Vickers}}</ref>

The Albanian republic was eventually replaced by another [[Kingdom of Albania (1928–39)|monarchy]] in 1928. In order to extend his direct control throughout the entire country, Zogu placed great emphasis on the construction of roads. Every male Albanian over the age of 16 years was legally bound to give ten days of free labor each year to the state.<ref name=":0" /> King Zogu remained a conservative, but initiated reforms. For example, in an attempt at social modernization, the custom of adding one's region to one's name was dropped. Zogu also made donations of land to international organisations for the building of schools and hospitals. The armed forces were trained and supervised by Italian instructors. As a counterweight, Zogu kept British officers in the [[Gendarmerie]] despite strong Italian pressure to remove them. The kingdom was supported by the [[Italian Fascism|fascist regime in Italy]] and the two countries maintained close relations until Italy's sudden [[Italian invasion of Albania|invasion of the country]] in 1939. Albania was occupied by [[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Albanian Kingdom (1943-1944)|then]] by [[Nazi Germany]] during World War II.

After being [[Italian invasion of Albania|militarily occupied by Italy]], from 1939 until 1943 the [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–43)|Albanian Kingdom]] was a [[protectorate]] and a [[Dependent territory|dependency]] of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] governed by the Italian King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] and his government. After the Axis' [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, territories of Yugoslavia with substantial Albanian population were annexed to Albania: most of Kosovo,{{efn|name=status}} as well as Western Macedonia, the town of [[Tutin, Serbia|Tutin]] in Central Serbia and a strip of Eastern Montenegro.<ref name="BogdaniLoughlin2007">{{cite book|last1=Bogdani|first1=Mirela|last2=Loughlin|first2=John|title=Albania and the European Union: The Tumultuous Journey Towards Integration and Accession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32Wu8H7t8MwC&pg=PA230|date=15 March 2007|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-308-7|page=230}}</ref> In November 1941, the small Albanian Communist groups established an&nbsp;Albanian Communist Party&nbsp;in Tirana of 130 members under the leadership of [[Enver Hoxha]] and an eleven-man Central Committee. The party at first had little mass appeal, and even its youth organization netted few recruits. [[File:Tirana Albania 1944-11-20.jpg|thumb|230px|[[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|Albanian partisans]] march in [[Tirana]] 29 November 1944]]

After the capitulation of Italy in 1943, Nazi Germany occupied Albania too. The nationalist [[Balli Kombëtar|Balli Kombetar]], which had fought against Italy, formed a "neutral" government in Tirana, and side by side with the Germans fought against the communist-led [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Movement of Albania]].<ref name="Morrock2010">{{cite book|last=Morrock|first=Richard|title=The Psychology of Genocide and Violent Oppression: A Study of Mass Cruelty from Nazi Germany to Rwanda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZtnAbKkOmIC&pg=PA55|date=11 October 2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5628-4|page=55|quote=The nationalist Balli Kombetar, which had fought against Italy, made a deal with the German invaders, and formed a "neutral" government in Tirana which&nbsp;...}}</ref> The Center for Relief to Civilian Populations (Geneva) reported that Albania was one of the most devastated countries in Europe. 60,000 houses were destroyed and about 10% of the population was left homeless.The communist partisans had regrouped and gained control of much of southern Albania in January 1944. However, they were subject to German attacks driving them out of certain areas. In the Congress of Përmet, the NLF formed an Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation to act as Albania's administration and legislature. By the last year in World War II Albania fell into a civil war-like state between the communists and nationalists. The communist partisans however defeated the last Balli Kombëtar forces in southern Albania by mid-summer 1944. Before the end of November, the main German troops had withdrawn from [[Tirana]], and the communists took control by attacking it. The partisans entirely liberated Albania from German occupation on 29 November 1944. A provisional government, which the communists had formed at&nbsp;Berat&nbsp;in October, administered Albania with Enver Hoxha as prime minister.

By the end of [[World War II]], the main military and political force in the country, the Communist party, sent forces to northern Albania against the nationalists to eliminate its rivals.

After the liberation of Albania from Nazi occupation, the country became a [[Communist state]], the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|People's Republic of Albania]] (renamed "the People's Socialist Republic of Albania" in 1976), which was led by [[Enver Hoxha]] and the [[Labour Party of Albania]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Envery Hoxha|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Enver-Hoxha|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopedia Brittanica|accessdate=November 22, 2016}}</ref>

The socialist reconstruction of Albania was launched immediately after the annulling of the monarchy and the establishment of a "[[People's Republic]]". In 1947, Albania's first railway line was completed, with the second one being completed eight months later. New land reform laws were passed granting ownership of the land to the workers and peasants who tilled it. Agriculture became [[Worker cooperative|cooperative]], and production increased significantly, leading to Albania's becoming agriculturally self-sufficient. By 1955, illiteracy was eliminated among Albania's adult population.<ref>''40 Years of Socialist Albania'', Dhimiter Picani</ref>

During this period Albania became industrialized and saw rapid economic growth, as well as unprecedented progress in the areas of education and health.<ref name="Albanian Nationalism"/> The average annual rate of Albania's national income was 29% higher than the world average and 56% higher than the European average.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dalakoglou|first=Dimitris|title=The Road from Capitalism to Capitalism |url= http://www.academia.edu/1934474/The_Road_from_Capitalism_to_Capitalism_Infrastructures_of_Post_Socialism_in_Albania|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=November 2016}} Albania's Communist [[Constitution of Albania|constitution]] did not allow taxes on individuals; instead, taxes were imposed on cooperatives and other organizations, with much the same effect.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pano|first=Aristotel|title=Panorama of the Economic-Social Development of Socialist Albania |url=http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/archive/panorama.htm|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>

Religious freedoms were severely curtailed during the Communist period, with all forms of worship being outlawed. In August 1945, the Agrarian Reform Law meant that large swaths of property owned by religious groups (mostly Islamic [[waqfs]]) were nationalized, along with the estates of monasteries and dioceses. Many believers, along with the [[ulema]] and many [[priests]], were arrested and executed. In 1949, a new Decree on Religious Communities required that all their activities be sanctioned by the state alone.<ref>Library of Congress Country Studies, Albania: Hoxha's Antireligious Campaign</ref>

In 1967, after hundreds of mosques and dozens of Islamic libraries containing priceless manuscripts were destroyed, Hoxha proclaimed Albania the "world's first [[State atheism|atheist state]]".<ref>Kombësia dhe feja në Shqipëri, 1920–1944 / Roberto Morocco dela Roka ; e përktheu nga origjinali Luan Omari.</ref><ref name = "Elsie p27">{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|last=Elsie|first=Robert|publisher=[[The Scarecrow Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8108-6188-6|edition=2nd|series=Historical Dictionaries of Europe, No. 75|location=Lanham, MD, and Plymouth|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&pg=PA27 27]}}</ref> The country's churches had not been spared either, and many were converted into cultural centers for young people. A 1967 law banned all "fascist, religious, warmongerish, antisocialist activity and propaganda." Preaching religion carried a three to ten-year prison sentence. Nonetheless, many Albanians continued to practice their beliefs secretly. The Hoxha dictatorship's anti-religious crusade attained its most fundamental legal and political expression a decade later: "The state recognizes no religion," declared Communist Albania's 1976 constitution, "and supports and carries out atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in people."<ref name = "Elsie p27" />

Hoxha's political successor [[Ramiz Alia]] oversaw the dismemberment of the "[[Hoxhaist]]" state during the breakup of the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the later 1980s.

After protests beginning in 1989 and reforms made by the communist government in 1990, the People's Republic was dissolved in 1991–92 and the Republic of Albania was founded. The communists retained a stronghold in parliament after popular support in the elections of 1991. However, in March 1992, amid liberalization policies resulting in economic collapse and social unrest, a new front led by the new [[Democratic Party of Albania|Democratic Party]] took power.

In the following years, much of the accumulated wealth of the country was invested in [[Ponzi scheme|Ponzi]] pyramid banking schemes, which were widely supported by government officials. The schemes swept up somewhere between one-sixth to one-third of the country's population.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jarvis, Christopher|year=2000|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2000/03/jarvis.htm |title=The Rise and Fall of the Albanian Pyramid Schemes|journal=Finance and Development|volume= 37|issue=1|pages=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Bezemer, Dirk|year=2001|title=Post-socialist Financial Fragility: The Case of Albania|journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics|volume=25|pages= 1–25|doi=10.1093/cje/25.1.1|jstor=23599718|hdl=10419/85494|hdl-access=free}}</ref> Despite IMF warnings in late 1996, then president [[Sali Berisha]] defended the schemes as large investment firms, leading more people to redirect their remittances and sell their homes and cattle for cash to deposit in the schemes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Musaraj, Smoki|year= 2011|title=Tales from Albarado: The Materiality of Pyramid Schemes in Post-socialist Albania|journal=Cultural Anthropology|volume= 26|issue=1|pages=84–110|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1360.2010.01081.x}}</ref> The schemes began to collapse in late 1996, leading many of the investors into initially peaceful protests against the government, requesting their money back. The protests turned violent in February as government forces responded with fire. In March the police and Republican Guard deserted, leaving their armories open. They were promptly emptied by militias and criminal gangs. The [[1997 rebellion in Albania|resulting crisis]] caused a wave of evacuations of foreign nationals and of refugees.<ref>The [[Albanian diaspora|mass emigration of Albanians]] was mostly to [[Albanians in Italy|Italy]], [[Albanian communities in Greece|Greece]], [[Albanians in Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Albanians in Germany|Germany]] and North America.</ref>

The crisis led Prime Minister [[Aleksandër Meksi]] to resign on 11 March 1997, followed by President [[Sali Berisha]] in July in the wake of the June General Election. In April 1997, [[Operation Alba]], a UN peacekeeping force led by Italy, entered the country with two goals: assistance in evacuation of expatriates and to secure the ground for international organizations. This was primarily WEU MAPE, who worked with the government in restructuring the judicial system and police. The Socialist Party won the elections in 1997, and a degree of political stabilization followed.

In 1999, the country was affected by the [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Kosovo War]], when a great number of Albanians from Kosovo found refuge in Albania.

Albania became a full member of [[NATO]] in 2009, and has [[Accession of Albania to the European Union|applied]] to join the [[European Union]]. In 2013, the Socialist Party won the national elections. In June 2014, the Republic of Albania became an official candidate for accession to the European Union.

== Geography ==
{{Main article|Geography of Albania}}
Albania has a total area of {{convert|28748|km2|0|abbr=off}}. It lies between latitudes [[42nd parallel north|42°]] and [[39th parallel north|39° N]] ([[Vermosh]]-[[Konispol]]) and between longitudes [[21st meridian east|21°]] and [[19th meridian east|19° E]] ([[Sazan Island|Sazan]]-[[Vernik]]). Albania's coastline length is {{convert|476|km|0|abbr=on}}<ref name="Albania pdf">{{cite web| author=Eftimi, R. |url=http://aguas.igme.es/igme/publica/tiac-02/ALBANIA-I.pdf|title=SOME CONSIDERATIONS ON SEAWATER-FRESHWATER RELATIONSHIP IN ALBANIAN COASTAL AREA|publisher=ITA Consult}}</ref>{{rp|240}} and extends along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea]]s. The lowlands of the west face the Adriatic Sea.

The 70% of the country that is mountainous is rugged and often inaccessible from the outside. The highest mountain is [[Mount Korab|Korab]] situated in the former [[district of Dibër]], reaching up to {{convert|2764|m|ft}}. The climate on the coast is typically [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] with mild, wet winters and warm, sunny, and rather dry summers.

Inland conditions vary depending on elevation, but the higher areas above 1,500&nbsp;m/5,000&nbsp;ft are rather cold and frequently snowy in winter; here cold conditions with snow may linger into spring. Besides the capital city of [[Tirana]], which has 420,000 inhabitants, the principal cities are [[Durrës]], [[Korçë]], [[Elbasan]], [[Shkodër]], [[Gjirokastër]], [[Vlorë]] and [[Kukës]]. In Albanian grammar, a word can have indefinite and definite forms, and this also applies to city names: both ''Tiranë'' and ''Tirana'', ''Shkodër'' and ''Shkodra'' are used.

The three largest and deepest tectonic lakes of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] are partly located in Albania. [[Lake Shkodër]] in the country's northwest has a surface which can vary between {{convert|370|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and 530&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, out of which one third belongs to Albania and the rest to Montenegro. The Albanian shoreline of the lake is {{convert|57|km|0|abbr=on}}. [[Ohrid Lake]] is situated in the country's southeast and is shared between Albania and Republic of Macedonia. It has a maximal depth of 289&nbsp;meters and a variety of unique flora and fauna can be found there, including "living fossils" and many endemic species. Because of its natural and historical value, Ohrid Lake is under the protection of [[UNESCO]]. There is also [[Lake Butrint]] which is a small tectonic lake. It is located in the [[Butrint National Park|National Park of Butrint]].

=== Climate ===
[[File:Albania koppen.svg|190px|thumb|Köppen climate types of Albania]]
With its coastline facing the Adriatic and Ionian seas, its highlands backed upon the elevated Balkan landmass, and the entire country lying at a latitude subject to a variety of weather patterns during the winter and summer seasons, Albania has a high number of climatic regions relative to its landmass. The coastal lowlands have typically Mediterranean climate; the highlands have a Mediterranean continental climate. In both the lowlands and the interior, the weather varies markedly from north to south.

The lowlands have mild winters, averaging about {{convert|7|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Summer temperatures average {{convert|24|°C|0|abbr=on}}. In the southern lowlands, temperatures average about {{convert|5|C-change|0|abbr=on}} higher throughout the year. The difference is greater than {{convert|5|C-change|0|abbr=on}} during the summer and somewhat less during the winter.

Inland temperatures are affected more by differences in elevation than by latitude or any other factor. Low winter temperatures in the mountains are caused by the continental air mass that dominates the weather in Eastern Europe. Northerly and northeasterly winds blow much of the time. Average summer temperatures are lower than in the coastal areas and much lower at higher elevations, but daily fluctuations are greater. Daytime maximum temperatures in the interior basins and [[river valley]]s are very high, but the nights are almost always cool.

Average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is heavy, a result of the convergence of the prevailing airflow from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the continental air mass. Because they usually meet at the point where the terrain rises, the heaviest rain falls in the central uplands. Vertical currents initiated when the Mediterranean air is uplifted also cause frequent thunderstorms. Many of these storms are accompanied by high local winds and torrential downpours.

When the continental air mass is weak, Mediterranean winds drop their moisture farther inland. When there is a dominant continental air mass, cold air spills onto the lowland areas, which occurs most frequently in the winter. Because the season's lower temperatures damage olive trees and citrus fruits, groves and orchards are restricted to sheltered places with southern and western exposures, even in areas with high average winter temperatures.

Lowland rainfall averages from {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} to more than {{convert|1500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} annually, with the higher levels in the north. Nearly 95% of the rain falls in the winter.

Rainfall in the upland mountain ranges is heavier. Adequate records are not available, and estimates vary widely, but annual averages are probably about {{convert|1800|mm|in|1|sp=us}} and are as high as {{convert|2550|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in some northern areas.

The higher inland mountains receive less precipitation than the intermediate uplands. Terrain differences cause wide local variations, but the seasonal distribution is the most consistent of any area.

Although a small country, Albania is distinguished for its rich [[biological]] diversity. The variation of geomorphology, climate and terrain create favorable conditions for a number of endemic and sub-endemic species with 27 endemic and 160 subendemic vascular plants present in the country. The total number of plants is over 3250 species, approximately 30% of the entire flora species found in Europe.

Over a third of the territory of Albania&nbsp;– about {{convert|10000|km2|0|abbr=off}};– is forested and the country is very rich in flora. About 3,000 different species of plants grow in Albania, many of which are used for medicinal purposes. [[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Albania belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]], the [[Mediterranean Region]] and the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]]. Coastal regions and lowlands have typical Mediterranean [[macchia]] vegetation, whereas [[oak]] forests and vegetation are found on higher elevations. Vast forests of [[European black pine|black pine]], [[beech]] and [[fir]] are found on higher mountains and alpine [[grasslands]] grow at elevations above 1800&nbsp;meters.<ref name="cbd.int">Bego, Ferdinand and Koni, Mynyr (1999) [http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/al/al-nbsap-01-p1-en.pdf "Albania"] in ''Blodlverslty Strategy and Action Plan''.

The forests are home to a wide range of mammals, including [[Gray wolf|wolves]], bears, [[wild boar]]s and [[chamois]]. [[Lynx]], [[wildcat]]s, [[pine marten]]s and [[European polecat|polecats]] are rare, but survive in some parts of the country.

There are around 760 vertebrate species found so far in Albania. Among these there are over 350 bird species, 330 freshwater and marine fish and 80 mammal species. There are some 91 globally threatened species found within the country, among which the [[Dalmatian pelican]], [[pygmy cormorant]], and the [[European sea sturgeon]]. Rocky coastal regions in the south provide good habitats for the endangered [[Mediterranean monk seal]].

Some of the most significant bird species found in the country include the [[golden eagle]]&nbsp;– known as the national symbol of Albania<ref name="Streissguth"/> &nbsp;– [[vulture]] species, [[capercaillie]] and numerous [[waterfowl]]. The Albanian forests still maintain significant communities of large mammals such as the [[brown bear]], [[gray wolf]], [[chamois]] and [[wild boar]].<ref name="cbd.int"/> The north and eastern mountains of the country are home to the last remaining [[Balkan lynx]]&nbsp;– a critically endangered population of the [[Eurasian lynx]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catsg.org/balkanlynx/20_blx-compendium/index.htm |title=The Balkan Lynx Conservation Compendium|publisher=Catsg.org |accessdate=29 December 2009}}</ref>

Issues of ethnicity are a delicate topic and subject to debate. "Although official statistics have suggested that Albania is one of the most homogenous countries in the region (with an over 97 per cent Albanian majority) minority groups (such as Greeks, Macedonians, Montenegrins, Roma and Vlachs/Aromanians) have often questioned the official data, claiming a larger share in the country's population.

Albania recognizes three national minorities, [[Greeks]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], and two cultural minorities, [[Aromanians]] and [[Romani people]].<ref>{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,COUNTRYPROF,ALB,,4954cdfe1a,0.html |title=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples&nbsp;– Albania : Overview |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=11 May 2005 |accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref> Other Albanian minorities are [[Bulgarians]], [[Gorani people|Gorani]], [[Serbs]], [[Egyptians (Balkans)|Balkan Egyptians]], [[Bosniaks]] and [[Jew]]s.

[[File:Albanian dialects.svg|thumb|190px|Map showing the various dialects of [[Albanian language|Albanian]] in Albania and all surrounding states.]]
[[Albanian language|Albanian]] is the official language of Albania. Its standard spoken and written form is revised and merged from the two main dialects, [[Gheg]] and [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], though it is notably based more on the Tosk dialect. [[Shkumbin]] river is the rough dividing line between the two dialects. Also a [[Greeks in Albania#Language|dialect of Greek]] that preserves features now lost in standard [[modern Greek]] is spoken in areas inhabited by the [[Greek minority in Albania|Greek minority]]. Other languages spoken by ethnic minorities in Albania include [[Aromanian language|Vlach]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Gora dialect|Gorani]], and [[Romani language|Roma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=albania |title=Languages of Albania |accessdate=31 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123044546/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Albania |archivedate=23 January 2009 }}</ref> Macedonian is official in the Pustec Municipality in East Albania.

Albanians are considered a polyglot nation and people. Due to immigration and past colonialism, Albanians generally speak more than 2 languages. English, Italian and Greek are by far the most widely spoken foreign languages, which are increasing due to migration return, and new Greek and Italian communities in the country. La Francophonie states 320,000 French speakers can be found in Albania. Other spoken languages include Serbian, Romanian, German, Turkish and Aromanian. Albanians in neighbouring Kosovo and Macedonia are often fluent in Albanian and Serbian, Turkish, Slavic Macedonian, and other former Yugoslav languages.

According to the 2011 population census, 2,765,610 or 98.767% of the population declared [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as their mother tongue ("mother tongue is defined as the first or main language spoken at home during childhood").<ref name="Population and Housing Census 2011"/>

The Albanians first appeared in the historical record in [[Byzantine]] sources of the late 11th century. At this point, they were already fully Christianized. [[Islam]] came for the first time in the 9th century to the region which is known as Albania today.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Jørgen Nielsen |author2=Samim Akgönül |author3=Ahmet Alibašić |author4=Egdunas Racius |title=Yearbook of Muslims in Europe|chapter=Albania|page=23|volume=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ia5AAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA351&lpg=PA351&dq=yearbook+islam+europa+albania&source=bl&ots=NfP5NcIwYX&sig=VvUvHqlH8VrkDQyN-CUgs0UweoA&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFgv7GkbzLAhWCBSwKHXbmABAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=albania&f=false|accessdate=12 March 2016|publisher=Brill|year=2013|location=Leiden, Boston, New York}}</ref> It later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories.

The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely [[anti-religious|banned religion]] to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first [[state atheism|atheist state]]. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership.<ref name="Mejdini">{{cite news|url=http://gazeta-shqip.com/lajme/2014/02/17/shqiperia-refuzon-organizaten-islamike-jo-pjese-e-aktivitetit-ne-teheran/|title=Shqipëria refuzon Organizatën Islamike, jo pjesë e aktivitetit në Teheran|last=Mejdini|first=Fatjona|date=17 February 2014|publisher=Shqip|language=Albanian|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref> Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the [[Sunni]] branch) are found throughout the country whereas [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albanian Orthodox Christians]] as well as [[Bektashi]]s are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country.<ref name="International Religious Freedom Report 2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90160.htm |title=Albania: International Religious Freedom Report 2007 |publisher=State.gov |date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=27 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828091818/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90160.htm |archivedate=28 August 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref>

The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] in the 19th century.{{bar box

The [[Military of Albania|Albanian Armed Forces]] (''Forcat e Armatosura të Shqipërisë'') were first formed after the country declared its independence in 1912. Albania reduced the number of active troops from 65,000 in 1988 to 14,500 in 2009.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1935630.stm |work=BBC News |title=Albania sells off its military hardware | date=17 April 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/08/21/feature-03 |title=Albania to abolish conscription by 2010 |publisher=SETimes.com |date=21 August 2008 |accessdate=29 December 2009}}</ref> The military now consists mainly of a small fleet of aircraft and sea vessels.

[[Tourism in Albania|Tourism]] is gaining in its share of Albania's GDP, with visitors growing every year. Exports increased 300% during 2008–14, although their contribution to the GDP is still moderate (the value of exports per capita stands at $1,100). Albania's growth slowed in 2013, though tourism continued its dramatic expansion, and FDI maintained its upward trend as the government continued its modernization program.<ref name="worlddiplomacy"/>

[[File:Berat Hoxha 18.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Sunset view of the [[Albania–Kosovo Highway]] with [[White Drin]] river flowing nearby.]]
Currently, there are three main motorways in Albania: the dual carriageway connecting Durrës with [[Vlorë]], the [[Albania–Kosovo Highway]], and the [[Tirana–Elbasan Highway]].

The A1 [[Albania–Kosovo Highway]] links Kosovo to Albania's Adriatic coast: the Albanian side was completed in June 2009,<ref>{{cite web|last=Wynne |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.nce.co.uk/news/transport/albania-motorway-making-the-first-move/5203302.article# |title=Albania highway: Making the first move |publisher=Nce.co.uk |accessdate=29 December 2009}}</ref> and now it takes only two hours and a half to go from the Kosovo border to [[Durrës]]. Overall the highway will be around {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} when it reaches [[Prishtina]]. The project was the biggest and most expensive infrastructure project ever undertaken in Albania. The cost of the highway appears to have breached €800&nbsp; million, although the exact cost for the total highway has yet to be confirmed by the government.

Two additional highways will be built in Albania in the near future: [[Pan-European corridors|Corridor VIII]], which will link Albania with the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria, and the north-south highway, which corresponds to the Albanian side of the [[Adriatic–Ionian motorway]], a larger regional highway connecting Croatia with Greece along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] coasts. When all three corridors are completed Albania will have an estimated 759&nbsp; kilometers of highway linking it with all its neighboring countries: Kosovo, the Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, and Greece.

=== Aviation ===
Aviation in Albania marked its beginning in March 1926 when German airline Adria Aero Lloyd begin service between Tirana, [[Shkodër]], [[Korçë]] and [[Vlorë]]. By 1924, the company had obtained a monopoly for all domestic routes. The project proved unprofitable, however, and Adria Aero Lloyd sold its concession to the Italian company [[Ala Littoria]], which started air service in 1935 to several domestic and international destinations.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6inIiCF_930C&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=adria+aero+lloyd&source=bl&ots=Q-wc_6y1vs&sig=g6J4y9M4N_bu60p1CD7HH2PvgTc&hl=pt-BR&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVvo-ilf3MAhUE2RoKHbMbD3UQ6AEIXTAH#v=onepage&q=adria%20aero%20lloyd&f=false Historical Dictionary of Albania] by Robert Elsie, pages 5 and 6</ref>

The construction of a more modern airport in [[Laprakë]] started in 1934 and was completed by the end of 1935. This new airport, which was later officially named "Airport of Tirana", was constructed in conformity with optimal technological parameters of that time, with a reinforced concrete runway of {{convert|2700|m|0|abbr=on}}, and complemented with technical equipment and appropriate buildings.  In 1938, Yugoslav carrier [[Aeroput]] introduced regular commercial flights linking Tirana with [[Belgrade]] with a landing in [[Dubrovnik]].<ref>[http://www.europeanairlines.no/drustvo-za-vazdusni-saobracaj-a-d-aeroput-1927-1948/ Drustvo za Vazdusni Saobracaj A D – Aeroput (1927–1948)] at europeanairlines.no</ref>

During 1955–57, the [[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza|Rinasi Airport]] was constructed for military purposes. Later, its administration was shifted to the Ministry of Transport. On 25 January 1957 the State-owned Enterprise of International Air Transport (Albtransport) established its headquarters in Tirana. [[Aeroflot]], [[Jat Airways]], [[Malév]], [[TAROM]] and [[Interflug]] were the air companies that started to have flights with Albania until 1960.<ref name="Tirana International Airport Website">{{cite web |url=http://www.tirana-airport.com/?RoseToken=169180229114147161160144183148154169229193083155156151160214184090168180231crc339 | title=History of the Airport | accessdate=15 January 2011 | publisher=Tirana International Airport Website}}</ref>

During 1960–78, several airlines ceased to operate in Albania due to the self-imposed isolationism of the Communist government under Enver Hoxha, resulting in a decrease of influx of flights and passengers. In 1977 Albania's government signed an agreement with Greece to open the country's first air links with non-communist Europe. As a result, [[Olympic Airlines|Olympic Airways]] was the first non-communist airline to commercially fly into Albania after World War II. By 1991 Albania had air links with many major European cities, including Paris, Rome, [[Zürich]], Vienna and [[Budapest]], but no regular domestic air service.<ref name="Tirana International Airport Website"/>

A French–Albanian joint venture [[Ada Air]], was launched in Albania as the first private airline, in 1991. The company offered flights in a thirty-six-passenger airplane four days a week between Tirana and [[Bari]], Italy and a charter service for domestic and international destinations.<ref name="Tirana International Airport Website"/>

From 1989 to 1991, because of political changes in the Eastern European countries, Albania adhered to the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO), opened its air space to international flights, and had its duties of Air Traffic Control defined. As a result of these developments, conditions were created to separate the activities of air traffic control from Albtransport. Instead, the National Agency of Air Traffic (NATA) was established as an independent enterprise. In addition, during these years, governmental agreements of civil air transport were established with countries such as Bulgaria, Germany, Slovenia, Italy, Russia, Austria, the UK and Macedonia.

The Directory General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) was established on 3 February 1991, to cope with the development required by the time. Albania has one [[international airport]], [[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza]], which is linked to 29 destinations by 14 airlines. It has seen a dramatic rise in passenger numbers and aircraft movements since the early 1990s.

=== Railways ===
{{Main article|Rail transport in Albania|Hekurudha Shqiptare}}

The railways in Albania are administered by the national railway company ''[[Hekurudha Shqiptare]]'' (HSH) (which means ''Albanian Railways''). It operates a {{RailGauge|1435 mm}} gauge (standard gauge) rail system in Albania. All trains are hauled by Czech-built [[ČKD]] [[diesel-electric locomotive]]s.

The railway system was extensively promoted by the [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime of [[Enver Hoxha]], during which time the use of private transport was effectively prohibited. Since the collapse of the former regime, there has been a considerable increase in car ownership and bus usage. Whilst some of the country's roads are still in very poor condition, there have been other developments (such as the construction of a motorway between Tirana and Durrës) which have taken much traffic away from the railways.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Education ==
{{Main article|Education in Albania}}

Before the establishment of the [[People's Republic]], Albania's illiteracy rate was as high as 85%. Schools were scarce between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. When the People's Republic was established in 1945, the [[Party of Labour of Albania|Party]] gave high priority to wiping out illiteracy. As part of a vast social campaign, anyone between the ages of 12 and 40 who could not read or write was mandated to attend classes to learn. By 1955, illiteracy was virtually eliminated among Albania's adult population.<ref name="Barbarian Invasions"/>

Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7%; the male [[literacy rate]] is 99.2% and female literacy rate is 98.3%.<ref name="cia"/> With large population movements in the 1990s to urban areas, the provision of education has undergone transformation as well. The [[University of Tirana]] is the oldest university in Albania, having been founded in October 1957.

Museum of Mediaeval Art in Korça.]]Albanian art has a long and eventful history. Albania, a country of southeastern Europe, has a unique culture from that of other European countries. The Ottoman Empire ruled over Albania for nearly five centuries, which greatly affected the country's artwork and artistic forms. After Albania's joining with the Ottoman Empire in 1478, Ottoman influenced art forms such as mosaics and muralpaintings became prevalent, and no real artistic change occurred until Albanian Liberation in 1912.

Following mosaics and murals of antiquity and the Middle Ages, the first paintings were icons Byzantine Orthodox tradition. Albanian earliest icons date from the late thirteenth century and generally estimated that their artistic peak reached in the eighteenth century. Among the most prominent representatives of the Albanian iconographic art were Onufri and David Selenica. The museums of Berat, Korca and Tirana good collections remaining icons. By the end of the Ottoman period, the painting was limited mostly to folk art and ornate mosques.<ref name="www.albanianart.net index_al">{{Cite web|title = Robert Elsie: Arti Shqiptar|url = http://www.albanianart.net/index_al.html|website = www.albanianart.net|accessdate = 22 November 2015}}</ref>

Paintings and sculpture arose in the first half of the twentieth century and reached a modest peak in the 1930s and 1940s, when the first organized art exhibitions at national level.<ref name="www.albanianart.net index_al"/> Contemporary Albanian artwork captures the struggle of everyday Albanians, however new artists are utilizing different artistic styles to convey this message. Albanian artists continue to move art forward, while their art still remains distinctively Albanian in content. Though among Albanian artist post-modernism was fairly recently introduced, there is a number of artists and works known internationally. Among most famous Albanian post-modernist are considered [[Anri Sala]], [[Sislej Xhafa]], and [[Helidon Gjergji]].

=== Music and folklore ===

[[File:Albanian Peasants costumes.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Albanian Peasants costumes – illustration by Percy Anderson for Costume Fanciful, Historical and Theatrical, 1906]]
Albanian folk music falls into three stylistic groups, with other important [[music area]]s around [[Shkodër]] and [[Tirana]]; the major groupings are the [[Gheg]]s of the north and southern Labs and [[Tosk Albanian|Tosks]]. The northern and southern traditions are contrasted by the "rugged and heroic" tone of the north and the "relaxed" form of the south. Southern instrumental music includes the sedate kaba, an ensemble-driven by a clarinet or violin alongside accordions and llautës. The kaba is an improvised and melancholic style with melodies that Kim Burton describes as "both fresh and ancient", "ornamented with swoops, glides and growls of an almost vocal quality", exemplifying the "combination of passion with restraint that is the hallmark of Albanian culture."

These disparate styles are unified by "the intensity that both performers and listeners give to their music as a medium for patriotic expression and as a vehicle carrying the narrative of [[oral history]]", as well as certain characteristics like the use of rhythms such as 3/8, 5/8 and 10/8.<ref>Arbatsky, Yuri, cited in Koco with the footnote ''Translated and published by Filip Fishta in Shkolla Kombëtare (The National School; No.1, May 1939), 19, and quoted from his Preface to [[Pjetër Dungu]]'s Lyra Shqiptare (see note 2).''</ref> The first compilation of Albanian folk music was made by two Himariots song artists [[Neço Muka]] and [[Koço Çakali]] in 1929 and 1931 in Paris during their interpretations with the Albanian song diva Tefta Tashko Koço. Several gramophone compilations were recorded in those years by this genial trio of Albanian artists which eventually led to the recognition of the Himariot Isopolyphonic Music as an UNESCO World Heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shekulli.com.al/m/post.php?id=362126#sthash.CGPYx8MA.dpbs|title=Kujtimet për Koço Çakalin, themeluesin e këngës himariote|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref>

Albanian folk songs can be divided into major groups, the heroic epics of the north, and the sweetly melodic lullabies, love songs, wedding music, work songs and other kinds of song. The music of various festivals and holidays is also an important part of Albanian folk song, especially those that celebrate St. Lazarus Day, which inaugurates the springtime. Lullabies and [[vajtim]]s are very important kinds of Albanian folk song, and are generally performed by solo women.<ref name="koco">{{cite web|title=Albanian Music |work=Eno Koco at the University of Leeds |url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/staff/ek/ |accessdate=28 August 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828104120/http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/staff/ek/ |archivedate=28 August 2005 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref>

Adams Edition: illustrated Published by Taylor & Francis, 1997 ISBN 978-1-884964-98-5, ISBN 978-1-884964-98-5 (''"Although there are some lexical items that appear to be shared between Romanian (and by extension Dacian) and Albanian, by far the strongest connections can be argued between Albanian and Illyrian."'' page 11)

Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of [[isogloss]]es with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long ''o'' has fallen to ''a'', much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative ''jos'' and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives.

The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric [[Gjon Buzuku]] brought into the Albanian language the [[Catholic liturgy]], trying to do for the Albanian language what [[Martin Luther|Luther]] did for German.

''[[Meshari]]'' (The Missal) by [[Gjon Buzuku]], published in 1555, is considered the first literary work of written Albanian. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.

The earliest evidence dates from 1332&nbsp;AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, [[Archbishop]] of [[Antivari]], who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin. Other significant examples include: a [[Formula e pagëzimit|baptism formula]] (''Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit'') from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of [[Durrës]], [[Pal Engjëlli]]; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment of the Bible from the [[Gospel of Matthew]], also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters.
[[File:Ismail Kadare.jpg|thumb|right|189px|[[Ismail Kadare]] ]]
Albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist [[Marin Barleti]], who, in his book [[Siege of Shkodra (1478)#The Book|''Rrethimi i Shkodrës'' (The Siege of Shkodër)]] (1504), confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (''in vernacula lingua'') as well as his famous biography of Skanderbeg [[Marin Barleti|''Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis'' (History of Skanderbeg)]] (1508). The History of Skanderbeg is still the foundation of Scanderbeg studies and is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national self-consciousness.

During the 16th to 17th centuries, the [[catechism]] ''E mbësuame krishterë'' (Christian Teachings) (1592) by [[Lekë Matrënga]], ''Doktrina e krishterë'' (The Christian Doctrine) (1618) and ''Rituale romanum'' (1621) by [[Pjetër Budi]], the first writer of original Albanian [[prose]] and poetry, an [[Remorse|apology]] for George Castriot (1636) by [[Frang Bardhi]], who also published a dictionary and [[folklore]] creations, the theological-philosophical treaty ''[[Cuneus Prophetarum]]'' (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by [[Pjetër Bogdani]], the most universal personality of Albanian [[Middle Ages]], were published in [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. The most famous Albanian writer is probably [[Ismail Kadare]].

=== Sports ===
Popular sports in Albania include [[Association Football|Football]], weightlifting, basketball, volleyball, tennis, swimming, [[rugby union]], and gymnastics. Football is the most popular sport in Albania. It is governed by the [[Football Association of Albania]] ({{lang-sq|Federata Shqiptare e Futbollit}}, F.SH.F.), which was created in 1930 and has membership in [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]].

Football arrived in Albania early in the 20th century when the inhabitants of the northern city of [[Shkodër]] were surprised to see a strange game being played by students at a Christian mission. The sport swiftly grew in popularity in a country then under Ottoman Empire rule.
Albania was the winner of the [[1946 Balkan Cup]] and the [[Rothmans International Tournament 2000|Malta Rothmans International Tournament 2000]], but had never participated in any major [[UEFA]] or [[FIFA]] tournament, until [[UEFA Euro 2016]], Albania's first ever appearance at the continental tournament and at a major men's football tournament. Albania scored their first ever goal in a major tournament and secured their first ever win in European Championship when they beat [[Romania national football team|Romania]] by 1–0 in a [[UEFA Euro 2016]] match on 19 June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/06/19/albania-vs-romania-euro-2016---live/|title=Euro 2016: Albania 0–1 Romania – Armando Sadiku scores the only goal to seal his country's first ever win at a major competition|work=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/romania-0-1-albania-armando-8233364|title=Romania 0–1 Albania – Sadiku scores landmark goal to provide last 16 hope|date=19 June 2016|work=mirror.co.uk|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref>

Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH) is the public radio and TV broadcaster of Albania, founded by [[King Zog]] in 1938. RTSH runs three analogue television stations as TVSH ''Televizioni Shqiptar'', four digital thematic stations as RTSH, and three radio stations using the name ''Radio Tirana''. In addition, 4 regional radio stations serve in the four extremities of Albania.The international service broadcasts radio programmes in Albanian and seven other languages via [[medium wave]] (AM) and [[short wave]] (SW).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://picasaweb.google.es/ec2adn/RadioTiranaBroadcastingSchedules/photo#5187887711939456834 |title=Radio Tirana's Broadcasting Schedule as of 2007&nbsp;– RadioTirana.org |publisher=Picasaweb.google.es |date=25 October 2008 |accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref> The international service has used the theme from the song "Keputa një gjethe dafine" as its [[signature tune]]. The international television service [[satellite|via satellite]] was launched since 1993 and aims at [[Albanian language|Albanian]] communities in Kosovo, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro and northern Greece, plus the Albanian [[diaspora]] in the rest of Europe. RTSH has a past of being heavily influenced by the ruling party in its reporting, whether that party be left or right wing.

According to the Albanian Media Authority, AMA, Albania has an estimated 257 media outlets, including 66 radio stations and 67 television stations, with three national, 62 local and more than 50 cable TV stations.
Last years Albania has organized several shows as a part of worldwide series like ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'', ''[[Big Brother Albania]]'', ''[[Albanians Got Talent]]'', ''[[The Voice of Albania]]'', and ''[[X Factor (Albanian TV series)|X Factor Albania]]''.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main article|Albanian cuisine}}

The cuisine of Albania&nbsp;– as with most [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkans|Balkan]] nations&nbsp;– is strongly influenced by its long history. At different times, the territory which is now Albania has been claimed or occupied by Greece, Serbia, Italy and the [[Ottoman Turk]]s and each group has left its mark on Albanian cuisine. The main meal of [[Albanians]] is the midday meal, which is usually accompanied by a [[salad]] of fresh vegetables such as tomatoes, [[cucumber]]s, green [[bell pepper|peppers]] and [[olive]]s with [[olive oil]], vinegar and salt. It also includes a main dish of vegetables and meat. Though it is used in several dishes, pumpkins are more commonly displayed and traditionally given as gifts throughout Albania, especially in the region of Berat. Seafood specialties are also common in the coastal cities of [[Durrës]], [[Sarandë]] and [[Vlorë]]. In high elevation localities, smoked meat and pickled preserves are common.

=== Health ===
Health care has been in a steep decline since the collapse of socialism in the country, but a process of modernization has been taking place since 2000.<ref name="hospitals">{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e80089.pdf |title=Albania-prel.pmd |format=PDF |accessdate=29 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227181701/http://www.euro.who.int/document/E80089.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref> In the 2000s, there were 51 hospitals in the country, including a [[military hospital]] and specialist facilities.<ref name="hospitals"/> Albania has successfully eradicated diseases such as [[malaria]].

Life expectancy is estimated at 78.3 years, ranking 61st worldwide, and outperforming a number of European Union countries, such as Slovenia, Estonia, Poland and Slovakia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html?countryName=Albania&countryCode=al&regionCode=eu&rank=51#al|title=LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH|publisher=CIA&nbsp;– The World Factbook}}</ref> The most common causes of death are circulatory diseases followed by cancerous illnesses. [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] completed a survey in April 2009, detailing various health statistics in Albania, including [[male circumcision]], abortion and more.<ref name="Albania DHS Surveys">{{cite web|url=http://www.measuredhs.com/countries/metadata.cfm?surv_id=327&ctry_id=72&SrvyTp=ctry&cn=Albania|title=Albania DHS Surveys|publisher=measuredhs.com|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>

The general improvement of health conditions in the country is reflected in the lower mortality rate, down to an estimated 6.49 deaths per 1,000 in 2000, as compared with 17.8 per 1,000 in 1938. In 2000, average life expectancy was estimated at 74 years, compared to 38 years at the end of World War II. Albania's infant mortality rate, estimated at 20 per 1,000 live births in 2000, has also declined over the years since the high rate of 151 per 1,000 live births in 1960. There were 69,802 births in 1999 and the fertility rate in 1999 was 2.5 while the maternal mortality rate was 65 per 100,000 live births in 1993. In addition, in 1997, Albania had high immunization rates for children up to one year old: tuberculosis at 94%; diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, 99%; measles, 95%; and polio, 99.5%. In 1996, the incidence of tuberculosis was 23 in 100,000 people. In 1995 there were two reported cases of AIDS and seven cases in 1996. In 2000 the number of people living with HIV/AIDS was estimated at less than 100. The leading causes of death are cardiovascular disease, trauma, cancer, and respiratory disease.
