Adam_of_Bremen.txt	'''Adam of Bremen''' (also: '''Adamus Bremensis''') was a [[Germany|German]] [[medieval]] [[chronicler]]. He lived and worked in the second half of the eleventh century. He is most famous for his chronicle ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum|Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum]]'' (''Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church'').

Little is known of his life other than hints from his own chronicles. He is believed to have come from [[Meissen]] ([[Latin]] ''Misnia'') in [[Saxony]].<ref name=gilman>{{cite book|last=Gilman, ed.|first=Daniels|title=The New International Encyclopedia|year=1905|publisher=Dodd, Mead & Co.|location=New York|pages=101|url=https://archive.org/stream/newinternational01gilm#page/101/mode/1up}}</ref> The dates of his birth and death are uncertain, but he was probably born before 1050 and died on 12 October of an unknown year (possibly 1081, at the latest 1085). From his chronicles it is apparent that he was familiar with a number of authors. The honorary name of ''Magister Adam'' shows that he had passed through all the stages of a higher education. It is probable that he was taught at the ''[[Magdeburg]]er Domschule''.

In 1066 or 1067 he was invited by archbishop [[Adalbert of Hamburg]] to join the [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Church of Bremen]].<ref name=remy>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01132c.htm Remy, Arthur F.J. "Adam of Bremen." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 20 Sept. 2012]</ref> Adam was accepted among the capitulars of Bremen, and by 1069 he appeared as director of the cathedral's school.<ref name=remy/> Soon thereafter he began to write the history of [[Bremen]]/[[Hamburg]] and of the northern lands in his ''Gesta''.

His position and the missionary activity of the church of Bremen allowed him to gather information on the history and the geography of [[Northern Germany]]. A stay at the court of [[Svend Estridson]] gave him the opportunity to find information about the history and geography of Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries.<ref name=remy/>
