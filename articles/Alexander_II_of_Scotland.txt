'''Alexander II''' ([[Middle Irish|Mediaeval Gaelic]]: ''{{lang|mga|Alaxandair mac Uilliam}}''; [[Scottish Gaelic|Modern Gaelic]]: ''{{lang|gd|Alasdair mac Uilleim}}''; 24 August 1198 – 6 July 1249) was [[King of Scots]] from
1214 until his death in 1249.

==Early life==

He was born at [[Haddington, East Lothian]], the only son of the Scottish king [[William the Lion]] and [[Ermengarde of Beaumont]]. He spent time in England ([[John of England]] knighted him at [[Clerkenwell Priory]] in 1213) before succeeding to the kingdom on the death of his father on 4 December 1214, being crowned at [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] on 6 December the same year.

==King of Scots==

In 1215, the year after his accession, the clans [[Meic Uilleim]] and [[MacHeths]], inveterate enemies of the Scottish crown, broke into revolt; but loyalist forces speedily quelled the insurrection. In the same year Alexander joined the English barons in their struggle against [[John of England]], and led an army into the [[Kingdom of England]] in support of their cause. This action led to the sacking of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] as John's forces ravaged the north.

The Scottish forces reached the south coast of England at the port of [[Dover]] where in September 1216, Alexander paid homage to the pretender [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis of France]] for his lands in England, chosen by the barons to replace King John. But [[John of England|John]] having died, the Pope and the English aristocracy changed their allegiance to his nine-year-old son, [[Henry III of England|Henry]], forcing the French and the Scots armies to return home.<ref name=bbc>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/articles/alexander_ii/ "Alexander II, King of Scots 1214 – 1249", Scotland's History, BBC]</ref>

Peace between Henry III, Louis of France, and Alexander followed on 12 September 1217 with the treaty of Kingston. Diplomacy further strengthened the reconciliation by the marriage of Alexander to Henry's sister [[Joan of England, Queen consort of Scotland|Joan of England]] on 18 June or 25 June 1221.

The next year marked the subjection of the hitherto semi-independent district of [[Argyll]]. Royal forces crushed a revolt in [[Galloway]] in 1235 without difficulty;<ref name=bbc/> nor did an invasion attempted soon afterwards by its exiled leaders meet with success. Soon afterwards a claim for homage from Henry of England drew forth from Alexander a counter-claim to the northern English counties. The two kingdoms, however, settled this dispute by a compromise in 1237. This was the [[Treaty of York]] which defined the boundary between the two kingdoms as running between the Solway Firth (in the west) and the mouth of the River Tweed (in the east).

Joan died in March 1238 in Essex.  Alexander married his second wife, [[Marie de Coucy]], the following year on 15 May 1239.  Together they had one son, the future [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], born in 1241.

A threat of invasion by Henry in 1243 for a time interrupted the friendly relations between the two countries; but the prompt action of Alexander in anticipating his attack, and the disinclination of the English barons for war, compelled him to [[Treaty of Newcastle (1244)|make peace]] next year at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. Alexander now turned his attention to securing the [[Western Isles]], which still owed a nominal allegiance to Norway. He repeatedly attempted negotiations and purchase, but without success.<ref name=bbc/>

The English chronicler [[Matthew Paris]] in his [[Chronica Majora]] described Alexander as red-haired:

"[King John] taunted King Alexander, and because he was red-headed, sent word to him,<br> 
saying, 'so shall we hunt the red fox-cub from his lairs."<ref>''Scottish annals from English chroniclers A.D.500 to 1286'', Alan Orr Anderson, Paul Watkins, 1991.</ref>

==Death==

[[File:Alexander II, King of Scotland, coat of arms (Royal MS 14 C VII, 146v).jpg|upright|right|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Coat of arms of Alexander II as it appears on folio 146v of Royal MS 14 C VII (''[[Historia Anglorum (Matthew Paris)|Historia Anglorum]]''). The inverted shield represents the king's death in 1249.]]

Alexander attempted to persuade [[Ewen MacDougall|Ewen]], the son of Duncan, Lord of [[Argyll]], to sever his allegiance to [[Haakon IV of Norway]]. When Ewen rejected these attempts, Alexander sailed forth to compel him, but on the way he suffered a fever at the Isle of [[Kerrera]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]]. He died there in 1249 and was buried at [[Melrose Abbey]]

==Wives==
1. '''[[Joan of England, Queen Consort of Scotland|Joan of England]]''', (22 July 1210 – 4 March 1238), was the eldest legitimate daughter and third child of [[John of England]] and [[Isabella of Angoulême]]. She and Alexander II married on 21 June 1221, at [[York Minster]]. Alexander was 23. Joan was 11. They had no children. Joan was Alexander's 3rd cousin, their closest common ancestor being [[Henry I of England]]. Joan died in [[Essex]] in 1238, and was buried at [[Tarrant Crawford|Tarant Crawford Abbey]] in [[Dorset]].

2. '''[[Marie de Coucy]]''', who became mother of [[Alexander III of Scotland]]. She was Alexander's 3rd cousin once removed by their common ancestor [[Hugh, Count of Vermandois|Hugh I, Count of Vermandois]].

==Fictional portrayals==

Alexander II has been depicted in historical novels:

* ''Sword of State'' (1999) by [[Nigel Tranter]]. The novel depicts the friendship between Alexander II and [[Patrick II, Earl of Dunbar]]. "Their friendship withstands treachery, danger and rivalry".<ref>[http://cunninghamh.tripod.com/books/9105.htm "Tranter First Edition Books, Publication Timeline"]</ref>
* ''Child of the Phoenix'' by [[Barbara Erskine]].
