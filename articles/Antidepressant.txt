'''Antidepressants''' are drugs used for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]] and other conditions, including [[dysthymia]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[chronic pain]], [[neuropathic pain]] and, in some cases, [[dysmenorrhoea]], snoring, [[migraine]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[addiction]], [[substance dependence|dependence]], and [[sleep disorder]]s. They may be prescribed alone or in combination with other medications.

The most important classes of antidepressants are the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs), [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s (TCAs), [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs), [[RMAO-A inhibitor|reversible monoamine oxidase A inhibitors]] (rMAO-A inhibitors), [[tetracyclic antidepressant]]s (TeCAs), and [[noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant]] (NaSSAs).<ref name="SJW and rMAO-A inhibitors – 2015" /> [[Hypericum perforatum#Major depressive disorder|St John's wort]] is also used in the treatment of depression.<ref name="SJW and rMAO-A inhibitors – 2015" /><ref name="SJW Cochrane review">{{cite journal |vauthors=Linde K, Berner MM, Kriston L | title = St John's wort for major depression | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 4 | pages = CD000448 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18843608 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000448.pub3 }}</ref>

For depression, the [[Hamilton Depression Rating Scale]] (HAM-D) is often used to measure the severity of depression.<ref name="pmid14399272">{{cite journal | author = Hamilton M | title = A rating scale for depression | journal = J.

==== Clinical guidelines ====

The UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) 2009 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be routinely used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor. The guidelines recommend that antidepressant treatment should be considered for:
* People with a history of moderate or severe depression,
* Those with mild depression that has been present for a long period,
* As a second-line treatment for mild depression that persists after other interventions,
* As a first-line treatment for moderate or severe depression.

The guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be used in combination with psychosocial interventions in most cases, should be continued for at least 6 months to reduce the risk of relapse, and that SSRIs are typically better tolerated than other antidepressants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg90/chapter/key-priorities-for-implementation |title=Depression in adults: The treatment and management of depression in adults |work=NICE guidelines [CG90] |date=October 2009 |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK) |accessdate=23 September 2015}}</ref>

[[American Psychiatric Association]] treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors that include severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and patient preference.  Options may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or light therapy.  Antidepressant medication is recommended as an initial treatment choice in people with mild, moderate, or severe major depression, and should be given to all patients with severe depression unless ECT is planned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookID=28&sectionID=1667485#654260 |title=PsychiatryOnline &#124; APA Practice Guidelines &#124; Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Major Depressive Disorder, Third Edition |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==== Systematic reviews ====

Conflicting results have arisen from studies analyzing the efficacy of antidepressants by comparisons to placebo in people with acute mild to moderate depression. Stronger evidence supports the usefulness of antidepressants in the treatment of depression that is chronic ([[dysthymia]]) or severe.

Researchers [[Irving Kirsch]] and Thomas Moore have contested the pharmacological activity of antidepressants in the relief of depression, and state that the evidence is most consistent a role as active [[placebo]]s.<ref name="administration2002">{{cite journal |title=The emperor's new drugs: An analysis of antidepressant medication data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  |vauthors=Kirsch I, Moore TJ, Scoboria A, Nicholls SS | journal = Prevention & Treatment | year = 2002 | volume = 5 | doi = 10.1037/1522-3736.5.1.523a }}</ref> Their study consisted of a meta analysis incorporating data from both published studies and unpublished data obtained from the FDA via a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request.  Overall, antidepressant pills worked 18% better than placebos, a statistically significant difference, but not one that is clinically significant.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/drugs/2002-07-08-antidepressants.htm |title=Study: Antidepressant barely better than placebo |newspaper=USA Today |date=7 July 2002 |accessdate=6 November 2008}}</ref> In a later publication, Kirsch concluded that the overall effect of new-generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for clinical significance.<ref name="pmid18303940">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirsch I, Deacon BJ, Huedo-Medina TB, Scoboria A, Moore TJ, Johnson BT | title = Initial Severity and Antidepressant Benefits: A Meta-Analysis of Data Submitted to the Food and Drug Administration | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = e45 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18303940 | pmc = 2253608 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045 }}</ref>

Another study focusing on paroxetine (Paxil) and imipramine found that antidepressant drugs were only slightly better than placebo in cases of mild or moderate depression they surveyed but offered "substantial" benefit in those with severe depression.<ref name="Fournier JC, DeRubeis RJ, Hollon SD, et al. 47–53">{{cite journal |vauthors=Fournier JC, DeRubeis RJ, Hollon SD |title=Antidepressant drug effects and depression severity: a patient-level meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=303 |issue=1 |pages=47–53 |date=January 2010  |pmid=20051569 |pmc=3712503 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1943 |url=|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

In 2014 the U.S. FDA published a systematic review of all antidepressant maintenance trials submitted to the agency between 1985 and 2012.  The authors concluded that maintenance treatment reduced the risk of relapse by 52% compared to placebo, and that this effect was primarily due to recurrent depression in the placebo group rather than a drug withdrawal effect.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Borges S, Chen YF, Laughren TP, Temple R, Patel HD, David PA, Mathis M, Unger E, Yang P, Khin NA |title=Review of maintenance trials for major depressive disorder: a 25-year perspective from the US Food and Drug Administration |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=205–14 |year=2014 |pmid=24717376 |doi=10.4088/JCP.13r08722 |url=}}</ref>

A review commissioned by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] concluded that there is strong evidence that SSRIs have greater efficacy than placebo on achieving a 50% reduction in depression scores in moderate and severe major depression, and that there is some evidence for a similar effect in mild depression. The treatment guidelines developed in conjunction with this review suggest that antidepressants should be considered in patients with moderate to severe depression and those with mild depression that is persistent or resistant to other treatment modalities.<ref name="Depression in Adults update">{{cite web |title=Depression in Adults (update) |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/Depression_Update_FULL_GUIDELINE.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=www.nice.org.uk |work=National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health Commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |accessdate=20 November 2013 |pages=282–292|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612122946/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/Depression_Update_FULL_GUIDELINE.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2013 }}</ref>

The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] recently performed a systematic review of clinical trials of the [[tricyclic antidepressant]] [[amitriptyline]]. The study concluded that in spite of moderate evidence for publication bias, there is strong evidence that the efficacy of amitriptyline is superior to placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Leucht C, Huhn M, Leucht S | title = Amitriptyline versus placebo for major depressive disorder | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | pages = CD009138 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23235671 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009138.pub2 | editor1-last = Leucht | editor1-first = C }}</ref>

A 2015 systematic review of add-on therapies for treatment-resistant depression concluded that [[quetiapine]] and [[aripiprazole]] have the strongest evidence-base supporting their efficacy, but they are associated with additional treatment-related side effects when used as an add-on therapy.<ref name="Adjunct therapy 2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhou X, Ravindran AV, Qin B, Del Giovane C, Li Q, Bauer M, Liu Y, Fang Y, da Silva T, Zhang Y, Fang L, Wang X, Xie P | title = Comparative efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of augmentation agents in treatment-resistant depression: systematic review and network meta-analysis | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 76 | issue = 4 | pages = e487–98 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25919841 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.14r09204 | quote = Quetiapine and aripiprazole appear to be the most robust evidence-based options for augmentation therapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression }}</ref>

A 2008 Cochrane Collaboration review on [[St John's wort]] (specifically, any extracts which contain ''[[hypericum perforatum]]''), and a 2015 meta-analytic systematic review by some of the same authors, both concluded that it: has superior efficacy to placebo in treating depression; is as effective as standard antidepressant pharmaceuticals for treating depression; and has fewer adverse effects than other antidepressants. The 2015 meta analysis concluded that it is difficult to assign a place for St. John's wort in the treatment of depression owing to limitations in the available evidence base, including large variations in efficacy seen in trials performed in German-speaking relative to other countries.<ref name="SJW and rMAO-A inhibitors – 2015">{{cite journal | vauthors = Linde K, Kriston L, Rücker G, Jamila S, Schumann I, Meissner K, Sigterman K, Schneider A | title = Efficacy and acceptability of pharmacological treatments for depressive disorders in primary care: systematic review and network meta-analysis | journal = Ann Fam Med | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–79 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25583895 | pmc = 4291268 | doi = 10.1370/afm.1687 | quote = In network meta-analysis, tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI; venlafaxine), a low-dose serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI; trazodone) and hypericum extracts were found to be significantly superior to placebo, with estimated odds ratios between 1.69 and 2.03. There were no statistically significant differences between these drug classes. Reversible inhibitors of monoaminoxidase A (rMAO-As) and hypericum extracts were associated with significantly fewer dropouts because of adverse effects compared with TCAs, SSRIs, the SNRI, a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (NRI), and noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant agents (NaSSAs).&nbsp;...  TCAs and SSRIs have the most solid evidence base. Further agents (hypericum, rMAO-As, SNRI, NRI, NaSSAs, SARI) showed some positive results, but limitations of the currently available evidence makes a clear recommendation on their place in clinical practice difficult.}}</ref><ref name="SJW Cochrane review" /> [[Reversible monoamine oxidase A inhibitor]]s (rMAO-A inhibitors) have also been shown to be an effective drug therapy with greater tolerability than other antidepressants;<ref name="SJW and rMAO-A inhibitors – 2015" /> however, the efficacy of SSRIs, tricyclic, and tetracyclic antidepressants in treating depression is supported by a much larger evidence base compared to other antidepressant drug therapies (i.e., St John's wort, rMAO-A inhibitors, [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]], [[serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor]]s, [[noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor]]s, and [[noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant]]s).<ref name="SJW and rMAO-A inhibitors – 2015" />

A study published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (''JAMA'') demonstrated that the magnitude of the placebo effect in clinical trials of depression have been growing over time, while the effect size of tested drugs has remained relatively constant. The authors suggest that one possible explanation for the growing placebo effect in clinical trials is the inclusion of larger number of participants with shorter term, mild, or spontaneously remitting depression as a result of decreasing stigma associated with antidepressant use.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Walsh BT, Seidman SN, Sysko R, Gould M | title = Placebo Response in Studies of Major Depression: Variable, Substantial, and Growing | journal = JAMA | volume = 287 | issue = 14 | pages = 1840–7 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11939870 | doi = 10.1001/jama.287.14.1840 }}</ref>  Placebo response rates in clinical trials of complementary and alternative (CAM) therapies are significantly lower than those in clinical trials of traditional antidepressants.<ref name="pmid20573327">{{cite journal | vauthors = Freeman MP, Mischoulon D, Tedeschini E, Goodness T, Cohen LS, Fava M, Papakostas GI | title = Complementary and alternative medicine for major depressive disorder: a meta-analysis of patient characteristics, placebo-response rates, and treatment outcomes relative to standard antidepressants | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 71 | issue = 6 | pages = 682–8 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20573327 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.10r05976blu | url = }}</ref>

A 2012 meta-analysis found that fluoxetine and venlafaxine were effective for major depression in all age groups. The authors also found no evidence of a relationship between baseline severity of depression and degree of benefit of antidepressants over placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gibbons|first1=RD|last2=Hur|first2=K|last3=Brown|first3=CH|last4=Davis|first4=JM|last5=Mann|first5=JJ|title=Benefits from antidepressants: synthesis of 6-week patient-level outcomes from double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials of fluoxetine and venlafaxine.|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|date=June 2012|volume=69|issue=6|pages=572–9|doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.2044|pmid=22393205|pmc=3371295}}</ref>

A review published in 2012 found a negative correlation between study year and efficacy of antidepressants as measured by response rate.  The change in response rate was largely driven by increase in placebo response.  However the authors still concluded that antidepressants were effective in treating depression.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Undurraga|first1=Juan|last2=Ross|first2=Baldessarini|title=Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants for Acute Major Depression: Thirty-Year Meta-Analytic Review|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=2012|volume=51|pages=851–864|doi=10.1038/npp.2011.306|pmid=22169941|pmc=3280655}}</ref>  The authors found that [[TCAs]] were the most effective drug, followed by [[SNRIs]], [[MAOIs]], [[SSRIs]] and atypical antidepressants.

Participants in the trial were recruited when they sought medical care at general medical or psychiatric clinics. No advertising was used to recruit subjects in order to maximize the generalizability of the study results. Participants were required to have a minimum score of 14 point on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D17) in order to be enrolled in the trial.

However, it is clear that residual symptoms are powerful predictors of relapse, with relapse rates 3–6&nbsp;times higher in patients with residual symptoms than in those who experience full remission.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tranter R, O'Donovan C, Chandarana P, Kennedy S | title = Prevalence and outcome of partial remission in depression | journal = Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 241–7 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12174733 | pmc = 161658 }}</ref> In addition, antidepressant drugs tend to lose efficacy over the course of treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Byrne SE, Rothschild AJ | title = Loss of Antidepressant Efficacy During Maintenance Therapy | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 59 | issue = 6 | pages = 279–88 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9671339 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v59n0602 }}</ref> According to data from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], less than one-third of Americans taking one antidepressant medication have seen a mental health professional in the previous year.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Antidepressant Use in Persons Aged 12 and Over: United States, 2005–2008|url = http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db76.htm|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-02-04|publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|series = Products - Data Briefs - Number 76 - October 2011}}</ref> A number of strategies are used in clinical practice to try to overcome these limits and variations.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mischoulon D, Nierenberg AA, Kizilbash L, Rosenbaum JF, Fava M | title = Strategies for managing depression refractory to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment: A survey of clinicians | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 476–81 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10900529 }}</ref> They include switching medication, augmentation, and combination.

==== "Trial and error" switching ====

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] 2000 Practice Guideline advises that where no response is achieved following six to eight weeks of treatment with an antidepressant, to switch to an antidepressant in the same class, then to a different class of antidepressant.
A 2006 meta-analysis review found wide variation in the findings of prior studies; for patients who had failed to respond to an SSRI antidepressant, between 12% and 86% showed a response to a new drug. However, the more antidepressants an individual had already tried, the less likely they were to benefit from a new antidepressant trial.<ref name="SSRIswitch" /> However, a later meta-analysis found no difference between switching to a new drug and staying on the old medication; although 34% of treatment resistant patients responded when switched to the new drug, 40% responded without being switched.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bschor T, Baethge C | title = No evidence for switching the antidepressant: Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of a common therapeutic strategy | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 121 | issue = 3 | pages = 174–9 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19703121 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01458.x }}</ref>

==== Augmentation and combination ====

For a partial response, the American Psychiatric Association guidelines suggest augmentation, or adding a drug from a different class. These include [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]] and [[thyroid]] augmentation, [[dopamine agonist]]s, [[sex steroid]]s, [[Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|NRIs]], [[glucocorticoid]]-specific agents, or the newer [[anticonvulsant]]s.<ref name="augment">{{cite journal |vauthors=DeBattista C, Lembke A | title = Update on augmentation of antidepressant response in resistant depression | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 435–40 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16318821 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-005-0064-x }}</ref>

A combination strategy involves adding another antidepressant, usually from a different class so as to have effect on other mechanisms. Although this may be used in clinical practice, there is little evidence for the relative efficacy or adverse effects of this strategy.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lam RW, Wan DD, Cohen NL, Kennedy SH | title = Combining Antidepressants for Treatment-Resistant Depression | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 63 | issue = 8 | pages = 685–93 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12197448 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v63n0805 }}</ref> Other tests recently conducted include the use of [[psychostimulant]]s as an augmentation therapy. Several studies have shown the efficacy of combining [[modafinil]] to treatment-resistant patients. It has been used to help combat SSRI-associated fatigue.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Goss AJ, Kaser M, Costafreda SG, Sahakian BJ, Fu CH | title=Modafinil augmentation therapy in unipolar and bipolar depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 74 | issue = 11 | pages = 1101–7| year = 2013 | pmid = 24330897 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.13r08560 }}</ref>

==== Long-term use ====

The therapeutic effects of antidepressants typically do not continue once the course of medication ends, resulting in a high rate of [[relapse]]. A recent [[meta-analysis]] of 31 placebo-controlled antidepressant trials, mostly limited to studies covering a period of one year, found that 18% of patients who had responded to an antidepressant relapsed while still taking it, compared to 41% whose antidepressant was switched for a [[placebo]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Geddes JR, Carney SM, Davies C, Furukawa TA, Kupfer DJ, Frank E, Goodwin GM | title = Relapse prevention with antidepressant drug treatment in depressive disorders: A systematic review | journal = The Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = 9358 | pages = 653–61 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12606176 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12599-8 }}</ref>

'''Where:'''

''For adverse effects/overdose toxicity''

4 means very strong effect/extreme toxicity.

3 strong effect; efficacious/high toxicity.

2 moderate effect/moderately toxic.

1 weak effect/weakly toxic.

v very weak/negligible effect

''For tolerability''

4 extremely tolerable. These drugs have proven to be better tolerated than the SSRIs.

3 very tolerable ? few, mild and transient side effects. These are drugs such as the [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|SSRIs]].

2 moderately tolerable. Some of the more tolerable of TCAs.

1 poor tolerability. TCAs and MAOIs mostly.

''For efficacy''

3 Superior efficacy drug, according to at least one review article.

2 Ordinary efficacy drug. Maybe some primary sources indicate superior efficacy relative to superior efficacy agents (e.g. agomelatine has shown superior efficacy to venlafaxine in one clinical trial) but insufficient data to say with much confidence.

[[QT interval|QTc i. p.]]: 2 (dose dependent; doses >40&nbsp;mg/day are particularly dangerous)

[[Escitalopram]]:
The more active S-enantiomer of citalopram. May be the most efficacious of the SSRIs (although no statistically significant difference between the efficacy of sertraline and escitalopram have been teased out to date). Based on the available evidence it is less toxic than its racemic counterpart, (R,S)-citalopram, in overdose. Less hepatotoxic than most other antidepressants.<ref name = Hep />

[[Fluoxetine]]:
First SSRI to receive FDA approval in 1987. Some studies have shown slight (often statistically insignificant) weight reductions in those on fluoxetine.

=== Anxiety disorders ===

==== Generalized anxiety disorder ====
Antidepressants are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD) that has failed to respond to conservative measures such as education and self-help activities. GAD is a common disorder of which the central feature is excessive worry about a number of different events. Key symptoms include excessive anxiety about multiple events and issues, and difficulty controlling worrisome thoughts that persists for at least 6 months.

Antidepressants provide a modest-to-moderate reduction in anxiety in GAD,<ref name="urlwww.nice.org.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13314/52599/52599.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |format= |work= |accessdate=20 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021044157/http://www.nice.org.uk:80/nicemedia/live/13314/52599/52599.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> and are superior to placebo in treating GAD.<ref name = Kapczinski>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kapczinski F, Lima MS, Souza JS, Schmitt R | title = Antidepressants for generalized anxiety disorder | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume =  | issue = 2 | pages = CD003592 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12804478 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003592 | url =  | editor1-last = Kapczinski | editor1-first = Flavio FK }}</ref> The efficacy of different antidepressants is similar.<ref name="urlwww.nice.org.uk" /><ref name = Kapczinski />

==== Obsessive-compulsive disorder ====
SSRIs are a second-line treatment of adult [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD) with mild functional impairment and as first-line treatment for those with moderate or severe impairment.  In children, SSRIs can be considered as a second-line therapy in those with moderate-to-severe impairment, with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg031niceguideline.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |format= |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206033654/https://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg031niceguideline.pdf |archivedate=6 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> SSRIs are efficacious in the treatment of OCD; patients treated with SSRIs are about twice as likely to respond to treatment as those treated with placebo.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Arroll B, Elley CR, Fishman T, Goodyear-Smith FA, Kenealy T, Blashki G, Kerse N, Macgillivray S | title = Antidepressants versus placebo for depression in primary care | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume =  | issue = 3 | pages = CD007954 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19588448 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007954 | url =  | editor1-last = Arroll | editor1-first = Bruce }}</ref><ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570825+</ref> Efficacy has been demonstrated both in short-term treatment trials of 6 to 24 weeks and in discontinuation trials of 28 to 52 weeks duration.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 22226028| year = 2012| author1 = Fineberg| first1 = N.

=== Eating disorders ===

Antidepressants are recommended as an alternative or additional first step to self-help programs in the treatment of [[bulimia nervosa]].<ref name="urlwww.nice.org.uk2">{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG9FullGuideline.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>  SSRIs (fluoxetine in particular) are preferred over other antidepressants due to their acceptability, tolerability, and superior reduction of symptoms in short-term trials. Long-term efficacy remains poorly characterized.  [[Bupropion]] is not recommended for the treatment of eating disorders due to an increased risk of seizure.<ref>https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a695033.html</ref>

=== Pain ===

==== Fibromyalgia ====

A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that antidepressants treatment favorably affects pain, health-related quality of life, depression, and sleep in [[fibromyalgia]] syndrome.  Tricyclics appear to be the most effective class, with moderate effects on pain and sleep and small effects on fatigue and health-related quality of life. The fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction on tricyclics was 48% versus 28% for placebo.  For SSRIs and SNRIs the fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction was 36% (20% in the placebo comparator arms) and 42% (32% in the corresponding placebo comparator arms). Discontinuation of treatment due to side effects was common.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Häuser W, Wolfe F, Tölle T, Uçeyler N, Sommer C | title = The role of antidepressants in the management of fibromyalgia syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 297–307 |date=April 2012 | pmid = 22452526 | doi = 10.2165/11598970-000000000-00000 | url =   }}</ref> Antidepressants including amitriptyline, fluoxetine, duloxetine, milnacipran, moclobemide, and pirlindole are recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) for the treatment of fibromyalgia based on "limited evidence".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enfa-europe.eu/assets/downloads/eular.pdf |title=www.enfa-europe.eu |format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>

=== General ===
{{Main article|Serotonin syndrome|MAOIs}}
Almost any medication involved with serotonin regulation has the potential to cause [[serotonin syndrome|serotonin toxicity]] (also known as ''serotonin syndrome''){{spaced ndash}} an excess of serotonin that can induce mania, restlessness, agitation, [[emotional lability]], insomnia and confusion as its primary symptoms.<ref name="pmid12771076">{{cite journal |vauthors=Birmes P, Coppin D, Schmitt L, Lauque D | title = Serotonin syndrome: a brief review | journal = CMAJ | volume = 168 | issue = 11 | pages = 1439–42 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12771076 | pmc = 155963 | doi =  }}</ref><ref name="pmid15784664">{{cite journal |vauthors=Boyer EW, Shannon M | title = The serotonin syndrome | journal = N.

[[MAOIs]] tend to have pronounced (sometimes fatal) interactions with a wide variety of medications and [[over-the-counter drug]]s.

Although these reactions may be lethal, the total number of deaths due to interactions and dietary concerns is comparable to over-the-counter medications.-->

In response to these adverse effects, a different type of MAOI has been developed: the [[reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A]] (RIMA) class of drugs. Their primary advantage is that they do not require the person to follow a special diet, while being purportedly effective as SSRIs and tricyclics in treating depressive disorders.<ref name="pmid7717091">{{cite journal | author = Paykel ES | title = Clinical efficacy of reversible and selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A in major depression | journal = Acta Psychiatr Scand Suppl | volume = 386 | issue =  | pages = 22–7 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7717091 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1995.tb05920.x }}</ref>

=== Pregnancy ===

SSRI use in pregnancy has been associated with a variety of risks with varying degrees of proof of causation.  As depression is independently associated with negative pregnancy outcomes, determining the extent to which observed associations between antidepressant use and specific adverse outcomes reflects a causative relationship has been difficult in some cases.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Malm H | title = Prenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and infant outcome | journal = Ther Drug Monit | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 607–14 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23042258 | doi = 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31826d07ea | url =   }}</ref>  In other cases, the attribution of adverse outcomes to antidepressant exposure seems fairly clear.

A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis found that antidepressant use during pregnancy was statistically significantly associated with some pregnancy outcomes, such as gestational age and preterm birth, but not with other outcomes. The same review cautioned that because differences between the exposed and unexposed groups were small, it was doubtful whether they were clinically significant.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Lori E.|last2=Grigoriadis|first2=Sophie|last3=Mamisashvili|first3=Lana|last4=VonderPorten|first4=Emily H.|last5=Roerecke|first5=Michael|last6=Rehm|first6=Jürgen|last7=Dennis|first7=Cindy-Lee|last8=Koren|first8=Gideon|last9=Steiner|first9=Meir|last10=Mousmanis|first10=Patricia|last11=Cheung|first11=Amy|title=Selected Pregnancy and Delivery Outcomes After Exposure to Antidepressant Medication|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|date=1 April 2013|volume=70|issue=4|pages=436|doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.684}}</ref>

A [[neonate]] (infant less than 28&nbsp;days old) may experience a withdrawal syndrome from abrupt discontinuation of the antidepressant at birth. Antidepressants have been shown to be present in varying amounts in breast milk, but their effects on infants are currently unknown.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lanza di Scalea T, Wisner KL | title = Antidepressant Medication Use During Breastfeeding | journal = Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 483–97 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19661763 | pmc = 2902256 | doi = 10.1097/GRF.0b013e3181b52bd6 }}</ref>

Moreover, SSRIs inhibit nitric oxide synthesis, which plays an important role in setting vascular tone. Several studies have pointed to an increased risk of prematurity associated with SSRI use, and this association may be due to an increase risk of [[pre-eclampsia]] of pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sivagnanam |first=G |title=Antidepressants |journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapeutics |year=2012 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=287–8 |url=http://www.jpharmacol.com/text.asp?2012/3/3/287/99452}}</ref>

=== Antidepressant-induced mania ===
Another possible problem with antidepressants is the chance of antidepressant-induced mania in patients with [[bipolar disorder]]. Many cases of bipolar depression are very similar to those of unipolar depression. Therefore, the patient can be misdiagnosed with unipolar depression and be given antidepressants. Studies have shown that antidepressant-induced mania can occur in 20–40% of bipolar patients.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldberg JF, Truman CJ | title = Antidepressant-induced mania: An overview of current controversies | journal = Bipolar Disorders | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 407–20 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14636364 | doi = 10.1046/j.1399-5618.2003.00067.x }}</ref> For bipolar depression, antidepressants (most frequently SSRIs) can exacerbate or trigger symptoms of [[hypomania]] and [[mania]].<ref name="pmid9387089">{{cite journal | author = Benazzi F | title = Antidepressant-associated hypomania in outpatient depression: a 203-case study in private practice | journal = J Affect Disord | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–7 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9387089 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0327(97)00082-7 }}</ref>

=== Suicide ===

Studies have shown that the use of antidepressants is correlated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and thinking (suicidality) in those aged under 25.<ref name="StoneETAL" /> This problem has been serious enough to warrant government intervention by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to warn of the increased risk of suicidality during antidepressant treatment.<ref name="pmid17485726">{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedman RA, Leon AC | title = Expanding the black box – depression, antidepressants, and the risk of suicide | journal = N.

Biochemical mechanisms suggested as causative include increased serotonin, particularly affecting [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT<sub>2</sub>]] and [[5HT3 receptor|5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors]]; decreased [[dopamine]]; decreased [[norepinephrine]]; blockade of [[cholinergic receptor|cholinergic]] and [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>adrenergic receptors]]; inhibition of [[nitric oxide synthase|nitric oxide synthetase]]; and elevation of [[prolactin]] levels.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Keltner NL, McAfee KM, Taylor CL | title = Biological Perspectives | journal = Perspectives in Psychiatric Care | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 111–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 12385082 | doi = 10.1111/j.1744-6163.2002.tb00665.x }}</ref> [[Mirtazapine]] is reported to have fewer sexual side-effects, most likely because it antagonizes 5-HT<sub>2</sub> and 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors and may, in some cases, reverse sexual dysfunction induced by SSRIs by the same mechanism.<ref name="pmid18278806">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ozmenler NK, Karlidere T, Bozkurt A, Yetkin S, Doruk A, Sutcigil L, Cansever A, Uzun O, Ozgen F, Ozsahin A | title = Mirtazapine augmentation in depressed patients with sexual dysfunction due to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors | journal = Hum Psychopharmacol | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 321–6 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18278806 | doi = 10.1002/hup.929 }}</ref>

The [[antihistamine|antihistaminic]] properties of certain TCA- and TeCA-class antidepressants have been shown to contribute to the common side-effects of increased appetite and weight gain associated with these classes of medication.

=== Discontinuation syndrome ===
{{Main article|Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome}}

Antidepressant discontinuation symptoms were first reported with [[imipramine]], the first tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), in the late 1950s, and each new class of antidepressants has brought reports of similar conditions, including [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs), SSRIs, and SNRIs.  As of 2001, at least 21 different antidepressants, covering all the major classes, were known to cause discontinuation syndromes.<ref name="DrugSaf2001-Haddad">{{cite journal |author=Haddad, P. |title=Antidepressant discontinuation syndromes |journal=Drug Saf |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=183–97 |year=2001 |pmid=11347722 |doi=10.2165/00002018-200124030-00003}}</ref>   The problem has been poorly studied, and most of the literature has been case reports or small clinical studies; incidence is hard to determine and controversial.<ref name="DrugSaf2001-Haddad" />

The earliest and probably most widely accepted scientific theory of antidepressant action is the [[monoamine hypothesis]] (which can be traced back to the 1950s), which states that depression is due to an imbalance (most often a deficiency) of the [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s (namely [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]]).<ref name = GG /> It was originally proposed based on the observation that certain hydrazine anti-tuberculosis agents produce antidepressant effects, which was later linked to their inhibitory effects on [[monoamine oxidase]], the enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of the monoamine neurotransmitters.<ref name = GG /> All currently marketed antidepressants have the monoamine hypothesis as their theoretical basis, with the possible exception of [[agomelatine]] which acts on a dual [[Melatonin|melatonergic]]-[[Serotonin|serotonergic]] pathway.<ref name = GG /> Despite the success of the monoamine hypothesis it has a number of limitations: for one, all monoaminergic antidepressants have a delayed onset of action of at least a week; and secondly, there are a sizeable portion (>40%) of depressed patients that do not adequately respond to monoaminergic antidepressants.<ref name="Infl">{{cite journal |vauthors=Maes M, Yirmyia R, Noraberg J, Brene S, Hibbeln J, Perini G, Kubera M, Bob P, Lerer B, Maj M | title = The inflammatory & neurodegenerative (I&ND) hypothesis of depression: leads for future research and new drug developments in depression | journal = Metabolic Brain Disease | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–53 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19085093 | doi = 10.1007/s11011-008-9118-1 }}</ref><ref name="glut">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sanacora G, Treccani G, Popoli M | title = Towards a glutamate hypothesis of depression: an emerging frontier of neuropsychopharmacology for mood disorders | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–77 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 21827775 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.07.036 | pmc=3205453}}</ref>  A number of alternative hypotheses have been proposed, including the glutamate, neurogenic, [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]], cortisol hypersecretion and inflammatory hypotheses.<ref name = Infl /><ref name = glut /><ref name="Epig">{{cite journal |vauthors=Menke A, Klengel T, Binder EB | title = Epigenetics, depression and antidepressant treatment | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design | volume = 18 | issue = 36 | pages = 5879–5889 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22681167 | doi = 10.2174/138161212803523590 }}</ref><ref name="Epig2">{{cite journal |vauthors=Vialou V, Feng J, Robison AJ, Nestler EJ | title = Epigenetic mechanisms of depression and antidepressant action | journal = Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–87 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23020296 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010611-134540 }}</ref>

===Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors===

[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) are believed to increase the [[extracellular]] level of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]] by [[Reuptake inhibitor|limiting]] its [[reuptake|reabsorption]] into the [[presynaptic cell]], increasing the level of [[serotonin]] in the [[synaptic cleft]] available to bind to the [[postsynaptic receptor]]. They have varying degrees of selectivity for the other [[monoamine transporter]]s, with pure SSRIs having only weak affinity for the [[norepinephrine transporter|norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine transporter]]s.

SSRIs are the most widely prescribed antidepressants in many countries.<ref name="PRESCORN2004">{{Cite book|vauthors=Preskorn SH, Ross R, Stanga CY |chapter=Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=sO_hArhCxwMC&pg=PA241 |editor1=Sheldon H.

===Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors===

[[Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs) are potent inhibitors of the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]]. These [[neurotransmitter]]s are known to play an important role in mood. SNRIs can be contrasted with the more widely used [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), which act mostly upon serotonin alone.

The human [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT) and [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET) are [[membrane protein]]s that are responsible for the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Balanced dual inhibition of [[monoamine]] reuptake can possibly offer advantages over other antidepressants drugs by treating a wider range of symptoms.<ref name="Cashman, J. R. and Ghirmai, S. (2009). Inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and inhibition of phosphodiesterase by multi-target inhibitors as potential agents for depression. ''Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 17'',  6890–6897 PMID 19740668">{{Cite journal|pmid=19740668|year=2009|last1=Cashman|first1=JR|last2=Ghirmai|first2=S|title=Inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and inhibition of phosphodiesterase by multi-target inhibitors as potential agents for depression|volume=17|issue=19|pages=6890–7|doi=10.1016/j.bmc.2009.08.025|journal=Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry}}</ref>

SNRIs are sometimes also used to treat [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), chronic [[neuropathic pain]], and [[fibromyalgia syndrome]] (FMS), and for the relief of [[menopause|menopausal]] symptoms.

===Serotonin modulators and stimulators===

[[Serotonin modulator and stimulator]]s (SMSs), sometimes referred to more simply as '''serotonin modulators''', are a type of [[drug]] with a multimodal action specific to the [[serotonin]] [[neurotransmitter]] system. To be precise, SMSs simultaneously modulate one or more [[serotonin receptor]]s and inhibit the [[reuptake]] of serotonin. The term was created to describe the [[mechanism of action]] of the serotonergic antidepressant [[vortioxetine]] ('''Brintellix/Trintellix'''), which acts as a [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SRI), [[partial agonist]] of the [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor]], and [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[5-HT3 receptor|5-HT<sub>3</sub>]] and [[5-HT7 receptor|5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor]]s.<ref name="pmid24391391">{{cite journal | author = Goldenberg MM | title = Pharmaceutical approval update | journal = P T | volume = 38 | issue = 11 | pages = 705–7 |date=November 2013  | pmid = 24391391 | pmc = 3875258 | doi = | url = }}</ref><ref name="AmerPharmAssoc2013">{{cite web | url = http://www.pharmacist.com/vortioxetine-atypical-antidepressant | author = American Pharmacists Association | title = Vortioxetine: Atypical antidepressant | year = 2013 }}</ref><ref name="LATimes2013">{{cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-fda-approval-antidepressant-20130930-story.html | author = Los Angeles Times | title = FDA approves a new antidepressant: Brintellix | year = 2013 }}</ref> However, it can also technically be applied to [[vilazodone]] ('''Viibryd'''), which is an antidepressant as well and acts as an SRI and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor partial agonist.<ref name="pmid15740724">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hughes ZA, Starr KR, Langmead CJ, etal | title = Neurochemical evaluation of the novel 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist/serotonin reuptake inhibitor, vilazodone | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 510 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 49–57 |date=March 2005 | pmid = 15740724 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.01.018 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0014-2999(05)00041-5}}</ref>

An alternative term is '''serotonin partial agonist/reuptake inhibitor''' ('''SPARI'''), which can be applied only to vilazodone.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Muntner|first1=Stephen M.

===Serotonin antagonists and reuptake inhibitors===

[[Serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors]] (SARIs) while mainly used as antidepressants, are also [[anxiolytic]]s and [[hypnotic]]s. They act by [[receptor antagonist|antagonizing]] [[serotonin receptor]]s such as [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] and [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibiting]] the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and/or [[dopamine]]. Additionally, most also act as [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonists]]. The majority of the currently marketed SARIs belong to the [[phenylpiperazine]] class of compounds.

===Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors===

[[Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (NRIs or NERIs) are a type of [[drug]] that acts as a [[reuptake inhibitor]] for the [[neurotransmitter]] [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) by blocking the [[drug action|action]] of the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET). This in turn leads to increased [[extracellular]] [[concentration]]s of norepinephrine.

NRIs are commonly used in the treatment of conditions like [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and [[narcolepsy]] due to their [[psychostimulant]] effects and in [[obesity]] due to their [[appetite suppressant]] effects. They are also frequently used as antidepressants for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]], [[anxiety disorder|anxiety]] and [[panic disorder]]. Additionally, many [[substance abuse|drugs of abuse]] such as [[cocaine]] and [[methylphenidate]] possess NRI activity, though it is important to mention that NRIs without combined [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (DRI) properties are not significantly rewarding and hence are considered to have a negligible [[abuse potential]].<ref name="pmid15283948">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wee S, Woolverton WL | title = Evaluation of the reinforcing effects of atomoxetine in monkeys: comparison to methylphenidate and desipramine | journal = Drug and Alcohol Dependence | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 271–6 |date=September 2004 | pmid = 15283948 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2004.03.010 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376871604000900}}</ref><ref name="pmid15526000">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gasior M, Bergman J, Kallman MJ, Paronis CA | title = Evaluation of the reinforcing effects of monoamine reuptake inhibitors under a concurrent schedule of food and i.v. drug delivery in rhesus monkeys | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 758–64 |date=April 2005 | pmid = 15526000 | doi = 10.1038/sj.npp.1300593 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.npp.1300593}}</ref> However, norepinephrine has been implicated as acting synergistically with dopamine when actions on the two neurotransmitters are combined (e.g., in the case of [[norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor|NDRI]]s) to produce rewarding effects in psychostimulant drugs of abuse.<ref name="pmid11071707">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Rothman RB, Baumann MH, Dersch CM, etal | title = Amphetamine-type central nervous system stimulants release norepinephrine more potently than they release dopamine and serotonin | journal = Synapse | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 32–41 |date=January 2001 | pmid = 11071707 | doi = 10.1002/1098-2396(20010101)39:1<32::AID-SYN5>3.0.CO;2-3 | url = }}</ref>

===Tricyclic antidepressants===

The majority of the [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s (TCAs) act primarily as [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs) by blocking the [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT) and the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET), respectively, which results in an elevation of the [[Synapse|synaptic]] concentrations of these [[neurotransmitter]]s, and therefore an enhancement of [[neurotransmission]].<ref name="pmid9537821">{{cite journal |vauthors=Tatsumi M, Groshan K, Blakely RD, Richelson E | title = Pharmacological profile of antidepressants and related compounds at human monoamine transporters | journal = Eur J Pharmacol. | volume = 340 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 249–258 | year = 1997 |pmid = 9537821 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-2999(97)01393-9 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17471183">{{cite journal | author = Gillman PK | title = Tricyclic antidepressant pharmacology and therapeutic drug interactions updated | journal = [[British Journal of Pharmacology]] | volume = 151 | issue = 6 | pages = 737–48 |date=July 2007 | pmid = 17471183 | pmc = 2014120 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0707253 | url =}}</ref> Notably, with the sole exception of [[amineptine]], the TCAs have negligible [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT), and therefore have no efficacy as [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]s (DRIs).<ref name="pmid9537821" /> Both [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]] have been highly implicated in [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], and it has been shown that facilitation of their activity has beneficial effects on these [[mental disorder]]s.<ref name="pmid9551776">{{cite journal|vauthors=Rénéric JP, Lucki I |title=Antidepressant behavioral effects by dual inhibition of monoamine reuptake in the rat forced swimming test |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=136|issue=2 |pages=190–7 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9551776 |doi=10.1007/s002130050555}}</ref>

Although TCAs are sometimes [[medical prescription|prescribed]] for depressive disorders, they have been largely replaced in clinical use in most parts of the world by newer antidepressants such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs) and [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (NRIs). Adverse effects have been found to be of a similar level between TCAs and SSRIs.<ref>Trindade E, Menon D, Topfer LA, Coloma C.

===Tetracyclic antidepressants===

[[Tetracyclic antidepressants]] (TeCAs) are a class of antidepressants that were first introduced in the 1970s. They are named after their [[chemical structure]], which contains four [[cyclic compound|rings of atoms]], and are closely related to the [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s (TCAs), which contain three rings of atoms.

===Monoamine oxidase inhibitors===

[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs) are chemicals which inhibit the activity of the [[monoamine oxidase|monoamine oxidase enzyme family]]. They have a long history of use as medications prescribed for the treatment of [[clinical depression|depression]]. They are particularly effective in treating [[atypical depression]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/major-depressive-disorder/atypical-depression-21st-century-diagnostic-and-treatment-issues | title=Atypical Depression in the 21st Century: Diagnostic and Treatment Issues| work=[[Psychiatric Times]] | accessdate=23 November 2013 | author=Cristancho, Mario}}</ref> They are also used in the treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]] and several other disorders.

Because of potentially lethal dietary and drug interactions, [[monoamine oxidase]] inhibitors have historically been reserved as a last line of treatment, used only when other classes of antidepressant drugs (for example [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s and [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s) have failed.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/depression/DS00175/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs Mayo Clinic Staff, "Depression (major depression): Treatment and drugs"]</ref>

MAOIs can also be used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease by targeting MAO-B in particular (therefore affecting [[dopaminergic neuron]]s), as well as providing an alternative for [[migraine]] [[prophylaxis]]. Inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B is used in the treatment of [[clinical depression]] and [[anxiety disorder]]s.

== Adjuncts ==

Adjunct medications are an umbrella term used to describe substances that increase the potency or "enhance" antidepressants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric_disorders/mood_disorders/depressive_disorders.html?qt=depression&alt=sh#v1028590 |work=Merck Manual |title=Depressive Disorders |accessdate=30 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205163219/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric_disorders/mood_disorders/depressive_disorders.html?qt=depression&alt=sh |archivedate=5 December 2013 }}</ref> They work by affecting variables very close to the antidepressant, sometimes affecting a completely different [[mechanism of action]]. This may be attempted when depression treatments have not been successful in the past.

Common types of adjunct medication techniques generally fall into the following categories:
* Two or more antidepressants taken together
** From the same class (affecting the same area of the brain, often at a much higher level)
** From different classes (affecting multiple parts of the brain not covered simultaneously by either drug alone)
* An [[antipsychotic]] combined with an antidepressant, particularly [[atypical antipsychotic]]s such as [[aripiprazole]] (Abilify), [[quetiapine]] (Seroquel), [[olanzapine]] (Zyprexa), and [[risperidone]] (Risperdal).<ref name="Maudsley">{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc |last1=Taylor |first1=D |last2=Carol |first2=P |last3=Shitij |first3=K |title=The Maudsley prescribing guidelines in psychiatry |year=2012 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=West Sussex |isbn=978-0-470-97969-3}}</ref><!--first added https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antidepressant&diff=prev&oldid=576824896-->

commented out 19 November 2013

However, the authors claim psychostimulants are likely to have a higher level of clinical effectiveness under circumstances in which the patient will probably die soon, so rapid relief is of great importance. In this situation, the patient is likely to die before dependence on, or tolerance of, the medication interferes with their care.

=== Isoniazid, iproniazid, and imipramine ===
In 1951, [[Irving Selikoff]] and Edward Robitzek, working out of Sea View Hospital on [[Staten Island]], began clinical trials on two new [[tuberculosis|anti-tuberculosis]] agents developed by Hoffman-LaRoche, [[isoniazid]] and [[iproniazid]]. Only patients with a poor [[prognosis]] were initially treated; nevertheless, their condition improved dramatically. Selikoff and Robitzek noted "a subtle general stimulation … the patients exhibited renewed vigor and indeed this occasionally served to introduce disciplinary problems."<ref name="pmid14906149">{{cite journal |vauthors=Selikoff IJ, Robitzek EH | title = Tuberculosis Chemotherapy with Hydrazine Derivatives of Isonicotinic Acid | journal = CHEST Journal | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 385–438 | year = 1952 | pmid = 14906149 | doi = 10.1378/chest.21.4.385 }}</ref> The promise of a cure for tuberculosis in the Sea View Hospital trials was excitedly discussed in the mainstream press.

In 1952, learning of the stimulating side effects of isoniazid, the Cincinnati psychiatrist Max Lurie tried it on his patients. In the following year, he and Harry Salzer reported that isoniazid improved depression in two thirds of their patients and coined the term ''antidepressant'' to describe its action.<ref name="isbn0-88048-397-0">{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc |last=Healy |first=D |editor1-last=Weissman |editor1-first=M.M. |title=The treatment of depression: bridging the 21st century |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LAmBVolIG5kC |accessdate=28 May 2009 |year=2001 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub |isbn=978-0-88048-397-1 |pages=10–11 |chapter=The Antidepressant Drama |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAmBVolIG5kC&printsec=frontcover#PPA7,M1}}</ref> A similar incident took place in Paris, where Jean Delay, head of psychiatry at Sainte-Anne Hospital, heard of this effect from his [[pulmonology]] colleagues at Cochin Hospital.

Selikoff and Robitzek also experimented with another anti-tuberculosis drug, [[iproniazid]]; it showed a greater psychostimulant effect, but more pronounced toxicity.<ref name="pmid12998444">{{cite journal |vauthors=Robitzek EH, Selikoff IJ, Mamlok E, Tendlau A | title = Isoniazid and Its Isopropyl Derivative in the Therapy of Tuberculosis in Humans: Comparative Therapeutic and Toxicologic Properties | journal = CHEST Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | year = 1953 | pmid = 12998444 | doi = 10.1378/chest.23.1.1 }}</ref> Later, Jackson Smith, Gordon Kamman, George Crane, and [[Frank Ayd]], described the psychiatric applications of iproniazid.

The antidepressant effect of a [[tricyclic]], a three ringed compound, was first discovered in 1957 by [[Roland Kuhn]] in a Swiss [[psychiatric hospital]]. [[Antihistamine]] derivatives were used to treat surgical shock and later as [[neuroleptics]]. Although in 1955 [[reserpine]] was shown to be more effective than placebo in alleviating anxious depression, neuroleptics were being developed as [[sedatives]] and [[antipsychotics]].{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Attempting to improve the effectiveness of [[chlorpromazine]], Kuhn{{spaced ndash}} in conjunction with the [[Geigy]] [[Pharmaceutical Company]]{{spaced ndash}} discovered the compound "G 22355", later renamed [[imipramine]]. Imipramine had a beneficial effect in patients with depression who showed mental and [[motor retardation]]. Kuhn described his new compound as a "thymoleptic" "taking hold of the emotions," in contrast with neuroleptics, "taking hold of the nerves" in 1955–56. These gradually became established, resulting in the patent and manufacture in the US in 1951 by Häfliger and SchinderA.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kuhn R | title = The treatment of depressive states with G 22355 (imipramine hydrochloride) | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 115 | issue = 5 | pages = 459–64 | year = 1958 | pmid = 13583250 }}</ref>

=== Second generation antidepressants ===
{{Main article|Second-generation antidepressants}}

Antidepressants became [[prescription drug]]s in the 1950s. It was estimated that no more than 50 to 100 individuals per million suffered from the kind of depression that these new drugs would treat, and pharmaceutical companies were not enthusiastic in marketing for this small market. Sales through the 1960s remained poor compared to the sales of tranquilizers,<ref>{{cite web |title=Tranquilizers |url=http://www.cmcsb.com/tranquil.htm |work=Cumberland Mountain Community Services |publisher=www.cmcsb.com |accessdate=20 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916074410/http://www.cmcsb.com/tranquil.htm |archivedate=16 September 2012}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=March 2013}}</ref> which were being marketed for different uses.<ref name="3faces">{{cite journal | author = Healy D | title = The Three Faces of the Antidepressants: A Critical Commentary on the Clinical-Economic Context of Diagnosis | journal = The Journal of Nervous & Mental Disease | volume = 187 | issue = 3 | pages = 174–80 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10086474 | doi = 10.1097/00005053-199903000-00007 }}</ref> Imipramine remained in common use and numerous successors were introduced. The use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) increased after the development and introduction of "reversible" forms affecting only the MAO-A subtype of inhibitors, making this drug safer to use.<ref name="3faces" /><ref>{{cite journal | author = Pletscher A | title = The discovery of antidepressants: A winding path | journal = Experientia | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–8 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1999242 | doi = 10.1007/BF02041242 }}</ref>

By the 1960s, it was thought that the mode of action of tricyclics was to inhibit norepinephrine reuptake. However, norepinephrine reuptake became associated with stimulating effects. Later tricyclics were thought to affect [[serotonin]] as proposed in 1969 by Carlsson and Lindqvist as well as Lapin and Oxenkrug.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Researchers began a process of [[rational drug design]] to isolate antihistamine-derived compounds that would selectively target these systems. The first such compound to be patented was [[zimelidine]] in 1971, while the first released clinically was [[indalpine]]. [[Fluoxetine]] was approved for commercial use by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1988, becoming the first [[Blockbuster drug|blockbuster]] SSRI. Fluoxetine was developed at [[Eli Lilly and Company]] in the early 1970s by [[Bryan Molloy]], [[Klaus Schmiegel]], David Wong and others.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Domino EF | title = History of modern psychopharmacology: A personal view with an emphasis on antidepressants | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 591–8 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10511010 | doi = 10.1097/00006842-199909000-00002 | url = http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10511010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wong DT, Bymaster FP, Horng JS, Molloy BB | title = A new selective inhibitor for uptake of serotonin into synaptosomes of rat brain: 3-(p-trifluoromethylphenoxy).

[[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]] fell out of favor in most countries through the 19th and 20th centuries, except in [[Germany]], where [[Hypericum]] extracts were eventually licensed, packaged and prescribed.

=== Prescription trends ===

In the United States, antidepressants were the most commonly prescribed medication in 2013.<ref name=AJantidepressantstatsUS /> Of the estimated 16 million "long term" (over 24 months) users, roughly 70 percent are female.<ref name=AJantidepressantstatsUS>{{cite web |last1=White|first1=Rebecca|title=Waking up from sadness: Many find trouble getting off antidepressants|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/1/22/patients-mostly-womenfindtroublegettingoffofantidepressants.html|website=Al Jazeera|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref>

In the UK, figures reported in 2010 indicated that the number of antidepressant prescribed by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) almost doubled over a decade.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jun/11/antidepressant-prescriptions-rise-nhs-recession |title=Antidepressant Use Rises as Recession Feeds Wave of Worry |date=11 June 2010 |accessdate=1 July 2010 |location=London |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Rowenna |last=Davis |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615165456/http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jun/11/antidepressant-prescriptions-rise-nhs-recession? |archivedate=15 June 2010  |deadurl=no}}</ref> Further analysis published in 2014 showed that number of antidepressants dispensed annually in the community went up by 25 million in the 14 years between 1998 and 2012, rising from 15 million to 40 million. Nearly 50% of this rise occurred in the four years after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 banking crash]], during which time the annual increase in prescriptions rose from 6.7% to 8.5%.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Spence|first1=Ruth|title=Focus on: Antidepressant prescribing|url=http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/focus-on/antidepressant-prescribing|website=QualityWatch|publisher=QualityWatch (Nuffield Trust/Health Foundation)|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref> These sources also suggest that aside from the recession, other factors that may influence changes in prescribing rates may include: improvements in diagnosis, a reduction of the [[Social stigma|stigma]] surrounding mental health, broader prescribing trends, GP characteristics, geographical location and housing status. Another factor that contribute to increasing consumption of antidepressants is the fact that these medications now are used for other conditions including [[social anxiety]] and [[post traumatic stress]].
