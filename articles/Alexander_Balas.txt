'''Alexander Balas''' ({{lang-grc|'''Ἀλέξανδρoς Bάλας'''}}), ruler of the [[Greece|Greek]] [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid kingdom]] in 150–146 BC. Alexander defeated his brother [[Demetrius Soter]] for the crown in 150 BC. Ruling briefly, he lost the crown to his brother during his defeat at the  [[battle of Antioch (145 BC)]] in Syria, dying shortly after.

==Biography==
===Early life and reign===
[[Image:AlexanderIBalasAndCleopatraThea.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Alexander Balas and Cleopatra Thea.]] 
He was a native of [[İzmir|Smyrna]] of humble origin, but gave himself out to be the son of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] and [[Laodice IV]] and heir to the Seleucid throne. Along with his sister [[Laodice VI]], the youngster Alexander was "discovered" by Heracleides, a former minister of Antiochus IV and brother of [[Timarchus]], an usurper in [[Medes|Media]] who had been executed by the reigning king [[Demetrius I of Syria|Demetrius I Soter]].<ref name="DGRBM">{{cite encyclopedia  | last = Smith  | first = Philip Peter | authorlink =  | title = Alexander Balas | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]  | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 114–115  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | location = Boston  | year = 1867  | url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0123.html }}</ref>

Alexander's claims were recognized by the [[Roman Senate]], [[Ptolemy VI of Egypt|Ptolemy Philometor of Egypt]] and others. He married [[Cleopatra Thea]], a daughter of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. At first unsuccessful, Alexander finally defeated Demetrius Soter in 150 BC. Being now master of the empire, he is said to have abandoned himself to a life of debauchery. Whatever the truth behind this, the young king was forced to depend heavily on his Ptolemaic support and even struck portraits with the characteristic features of king [[Ptolemy I]].

===Final battle and death===
[[Image:AlexanderI.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Silver coin of Alexander I "Balas". The Greek inscription reads ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΑΛΕΧΑΝΔΡΟΥ (king Alexander). The date ΓΞΡ is year 163 of the [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucid era]], corresponding to 150&ndash;149 BC.]]
Demetrius Soter's son [[Demetrius II of Syria|Demetrius II]] profited by the opportunity to regain the throne. Ptolemy Philometor, who was Alexander's father-in-law, went over to his side, and Alexander was defeated in the  [[battle of Antioch (145 BC)]] in Syria, sometimes known as the battle of the Oenoparus.

He fled for refuge to a [[Nabataea]]n prince, who murdered him and sent his head to Ptolemy Philometor, who had been mortally wounded in the engagement.<ref>{{EB1911|wstitle=Alexander Balas|volume=1}}</ref>
