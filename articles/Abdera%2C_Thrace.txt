'''Abdera''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|b|ˈ|d|ɪr|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἄβδηρα}}) was a major [[ancient Greece|Greek]] ''[[polis]]'' on the coast of [[Thrace]]. It lay 17&nbsp;km east-northeast of the mouth of the [[Nestos River]], almost directly opposite the island of [[Thasos]]. The site now lies in the [[Xanthi (regional unit)|Xanthi]] regional unit of [[western Thrace|Thrace]], [[Greece]]. The municipality of Abdera ([[Modern Greek]]: {{lang|el|Άβδηρα}} {{IPA-el|ˈavðira|}}) has 19,005 inhabitants (2011). The seat of the municipality is the town [[Genisea]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web3.eetaa.gr:8080/metaboles/show_metaboles_ota.jsp?toponymio_code=6910 |title=Administrative changes in OTA |date=4 December 1997 |publisher=EETAA |accessdate=9 December 2016 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20161212141303/http://web3.eetaa.gr:8080/metaboles/show_metaboles_ota.jsp?toponymio_code=6910 |archivedate=12 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}</ref> 

==History==

[[File:Abderacoin.png|thumb|200px|right|The chief coin type, with griffon.]]
Its mythical foundation was attributed to [[Heracles]] who founded the city on behalf of his fallen friend [[Abderus]].<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke|Bibliotheca]]'', ed. Wagner, R. Leipzig: Teubner, 1894; ''Mythographi Graeci'' 1, Chapter 2, section 97, line 7ff.</ref> The historical founding is traced back to a colony from [[Klazomenai]].  This historical founding was traditionally dated to 654 BC, which is unverified, although evidence in 7th century BC [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek pottery]] tends to support it.<ref name="OCD">{{cite encyclopedia| last = Hornblower| first = Simon| title = Abdera | encyclopedia = The Oxford Classical Dictionary| pages = 1| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| year = 1996}}</ref>  But its prosperity dates from 544 BC, when the majority of the people of [[Teos]] (including the poet [[Anacreon]]) migrated to Abdera to escape the [[Iran|Persian]] yoke ([[Herodotus]] i.168).<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Abdera |edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location= Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=19}}</ref>  The chief coin type, a ''[[griffon]]'', is identical with that of Teos; the rich silver coinage is noted for the beauty and variety of its reverse types.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abdera (Thrace)|display=Abdera|volume=1|page=33}} Endnotes:

In 513 BC and 512 BC, the Persians conquered Abdera. In 496 BC, the Persians again conquered Abdera, this time under [[Darius I]]. It later became part of the [[Delian League]] and fought on the side of Athens in the [[Peloponnesian war]].<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Bibliotheca historica'', ed. Vogel, F., Fischer, K.T. (post I. Bekker & L. Dindorf), Leipzig: Teubner, 1:1888; 2:1890; 3:1893; 4–5:1906, Repr. 1964. Book 13, chapter 72, section 2, line 2.</ref>

Abdera was a wealthy city, the third richest in the League, due to its status as a prime port for trade with the interior of Thrace and the [[Odrysian kingdom]].<ref name="OCD"/>

A valuable prize, the city was repeatedly sacked: by the [[Triballi]] in 376 BC, [[Philip II of Macedon]] in 350 BC; later by [[Lysimachus|Lysimachos of Thrace]],<ref name=EB/> the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]], the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]], and again by the Macedonians. In 170 BC the Roman armies and those of [[Eumenes II|Eumenes II of Pergamon]] besieged and sacked it.

The town seems to have declined in importance after the middle of the 4th century BC.<ref name="EB1911"/> Cicero ridicules the city in his letters to Atticus, "Hic, Abdera non tacente me" <ref>Cicero. ''Epistulae ad Atticum'',  4.17.3, 7.7.4.</ref> but the city counted among its citizens the philosophers [[Democritus]], [[Protagoras]]<ref name=EB/> and [[Anaxarchus]], historian and philosopher [[Hecataeus of Abdera]], and the lyric poet [[Anacreon]].

Abdera had flourished especially in ancient times mainly for two reasons : because of the large area of their territory and their highly strategic position. The city controlled two great road passages (one of Nestos river and other through the mountains north of Xanthi). Furthermore, from their ports passed the sea road, which from Troas led to the Thracian and then the Macedonian coast.<ref>D. C. Samsaris, Historical  Geography of Western Thrace during the Roman Antiquity (in Greek), Thessaloniki 2005, p. 91-96</ref>

The ruins of the town may still be seen on Cape Balastra (40°56'1.02"N 24°58'21.81"E); they cover seven small hills, and extend from an eastern to a western harbor; on the southwestern hills are the remains of the medieval settlement of Polystylon.<ref name="EB1911"/>

==Municipality==
The municipality Abdera was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 3 former municipalities, that became municipal units:<ref name=Kallikratis>[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}</ref>
