'''Ash''' or '''ashes''' are the solid remains of [[fire]]s. Specifically, it refers to all non-[[aqueous]], non-[[gaseous]] residues that remain after something is [[combustion|burned]]. In analytical chemistry, in order to analyse the mineral and metal content of [[chemical sample]]s,  [[ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]] is the non-[[gaseous]], non-[[liquid]] residue after a complete combustion.

Ashes as the end product of [[incomplete combustion]] will be mostly [[mineral]], but usually still contain an amount of [[combustible]] [[organic compound|organic]] or other [[Redox|oxidizable]] residues. The best-known type of ash is [[wood ash]], as a product of wood combustion in [[campfire]]s, [[fireplace]]s, etc. The darker the wood ashes, the higher the content of remaining [[charcoal]] will be due to incomplete combustion.

Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent (alkaline).<ref>Howard et al. 2002: Healthy Villages A guide for communities and community health workers.
