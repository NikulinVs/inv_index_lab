The Hebrew term '''''Abaddon''''' ({{lang-he|אֲבַדּוֹן}}, ''{{lang|he-Latn|'Ǎḇaddōn}}''), and its Greek equivalent '''''Apollyon''''' ({{lang-gr|Ἀπολλύων}}, ''Apollyon''), appears in the [[Bible]] as both a place of destruction and as the name of an [[angel]]. In the [[Hebrew Bible]], ''abaddon'' is used with reference to a [[Abyss (religion)|bottomless pit]], often appearing alongside the place שאול (''[[sheol]]''), meaning the realm of the dead. In the New Testament [[Book of Revelation]], an angel called Abaddon is described as the king of an army of [[locust]]s; his name is first transcribed in Greek (Revelation 9:11&mdash;"whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon" (Ἀβαδδὼν), and then translated ("which in Greek means the Destroyer" (Ἀπολλύων, ''Apollyon'')). The Latin [[Vulgate]] and the [[Douay Rheims Bible]] have additional notes (not present in the Greek text), "in Latin Exterminans", ''exterminans'' being the Latin word for "destroyer".

==Etymology==
According to the [[Brown Driver Briggs]] lexicon, the Hebrew ''abaddon'' (Hebrew: אבדון; avadon) is an intensive form of the [[Semitic root]] and verb stem ''abad'' (אָבַד) "perish" (transitive "destroy"), which occurs 184 times in the Hebrew Bible. The [[Septuagint]], an early Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, renders "abaddon" as "ἀπώλεια",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studylight.org/com/jab/view.cgi?bk=65&ch=9 |title=Revelation 9:1 - Johann Albrecht Bengel's Gnomon of the New Testament - Commentaries |publisher=StudyLight.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref> while the Greek ''Apollyon'' comes from ''apollumi'' ([[:wikt:ἀπόλλυμι|ἀπόλλυμι]]), "to destroy". The Greek term ''Apollyon'' ([[:wikt:Ἀπολλύων|Ἀπολλύων]], "the destroyer"), is the [[active participle]] of ''apollumi'' ([[:wikt:ἀπόλλυμι|ἀπόλλυμι]], "to destroy"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=a%29po%2Flluwn&la=greek |title=Greek Word Study Tool |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref> and is not used as a name in classical Greek texts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=a)po%252Fllumi&la=greek#lexicon |title=Greek Word Study Tool |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref>

==Judaism==

===Hebrew Bible===
The term ''abaddon'' appears six times in the [[Masoretic text]] of the Hebrew Bible; ''abaddon'' means destruction or "place of destruction", or the realm of the dead, and is accompanied by [[Sheol]]. 
* [[Book of Job|Job]] 26:6: the grave (Sheol) is naked before Him, and destruction (Abaddon) has no covering.
* Job 28:22: destruction (Abaddon) and death say..
* Job 31:12: it is a fire that consumes to destruction (Abaddon)...
* [[Book of Psalms|Psalm]] 88:11: Shall thy loving kindness be declared in the grave (Sheol) or thy faithfulness in destruction (Abaddon)?
* [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 15:11: Hell (Sheol) and Destruction (Abaddon) are before the LORD, how much more than the hearts of the children of men?
* Proverbs 27:20: Hell (Sheol) and Destruction (Abaddon) are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. ([[Authorised King James Version|KJV]], 1611)

===Second Temple era texts===
The text of the [[Thanksgiving Hymns]]&mdash;which was found in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]&mdash;tells of "the Sheol of Abaddon" and of the "torrents of [[Belial]] [that] burst into Abaddon". The ''[[Pseudo-Philo|Biblical Antiquities]]'' (misattributed to [[Philo]]) mentions Abaddon as a place (destruction) rather than an individual. Abaddon is also one of the compartments of [[Gehenna]].<ref name="oxford">{{cite book|last1=Metzger|first1=Bruce M.|last2=Coogan|first2=Michael David|title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199743916|page=3}}</ref> By extension, it can mean an underworld abode of lost souls, or [[Gehenna]].

===Rabbinical literature===
In some legends, Abaddon is identified as a realm where the [[Damnation|damned]] lie in fire and snow, one of the places in [[Gehenna]] that [[Moses]] visited.<ref name="Ginzberg">{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/loj/loj206.htm |title=Chapter IV: Moses in Egypt |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-03}}</ref>

==Christianity==

===New Testament===
The [[Scriptures#Christianity|Christian scriptures]] contain the first known depiction of ''Abaddon'' as an individual entity instead of a place.

In [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 9:11, Abaddon is described as "Destroyer",<ref name="biblegateway">{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%209:11&version=NIV |title=Revelation 9:11 NIV - They had as king over them the angel of |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref> the angel of the [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]],<ref name="biblegateway"/> and as the king of a plague of locusts resembling horses with crowned human faces, women's hair, lions' teeth, wings, iron breast-plates, and a tail with a scorpion's stinger that torments for five months anyone who does not have the seal of God on their foreheads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%209:7-10&version=NIV |title=Revelation 9:7-10 NIV - The locusts looked like horses prepared |publisher=Bible Gateway |date= |accessdate=2014-04-03}}</ref>

The symbolism of Revelation 9:11 leaves the identity of Abaddon open to interpretation. Protestant commentator [[Matthew Henry]] (1708) believed Abaddon to be the [[Antichrist]],<ref name="henry">{{cite web|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/commentaries/comm_view.cfm?AuthorID%3D4%26contentID%3D1868%26commInfo%3D5%26topic%3DRevelation |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607035557/http://www.blueletterbible.org/commentaries/comm_view.cfm?AuthorID=4&contentID=1868&commInfo=5&topic=Revelation |archivedate=7 June 2015 }}</ref> whereas the [[Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Commentary]] (1871) and [[Henry H.

In contrast, the [[Methodist]] publication ''The Interpreter's Bible'' states: "Abaddon, however, is an angel not of Satan but of God, performing his work of destruction at God's bidding", citing the context at Revelation chapter 20, verses 1 through 3.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Keck|first1=Leander E.|title=The New Interpreter's Bible: Hebrews - Revelation (Volume 12)|date=1998|publisher=Abingdon Press|location=Nashville, Tenn.|isbn=0687278252|edition=[Nachdr.]}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2016}} [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] as well cite Revelation 20:1-3 where the angel having "the key of the abyss" is actually shown to be a representative of God, one from heaven, and, rather than being "satanic", is the one that binds Satan and hurls him into the abyss; concluding that "Abaddon" is another name for Jesus Christ after his resurrection. To give further understanding, the book "Insight from The Scriptures, Vol. 1 presents the following information: "ABADDON: (A·badʹdon) [from Heb., meaning “Destruction”].
At Revelation 9:11 this Hebrew word is transliterated into the English text. There we read concerning the symbolic plague of locusts that they have “a king, the angel of the abyss. In Hebrew his name is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.”
In Hebrew the word ʼavad·dohnʹ means “destruction” and may also refer to “the place of destruction.” It appears in the original Hebrew text a total of five times, and in four of the occurrences it is used to parallel “the burial place,” “Sheol,” and “death.” (Ps 88:11; Job 26:6; 28:22; Pr 15:11) The word ʼavad·dohnʹ in these texts evidently refers to the destructive processes that ensue with human death, and these scriptures indicate that decay or destruction takes place in Sheol, the common grave of mankind. At Job 31:12 ʼavad·dohnʹ designates the damaging effect of an adulterous course. Job declared: “That [adulterous course] is a fire that would eat clear to destruction [ʽadh-ʼavad·dohnʹ], and among all my produce it would take root.”—Compare Pr 6:26-28, 32; 7:26, 27.
Abaddon, the angel of the abyss—who is he?
At Revelation 9:11, however, the word “Abaddon” is used as the name of “the angel of the abyss.” The corresponding Greek name Apollyon means “Destroyer.” In the 19th century there were efforts made to show that this text prophetically applied to individuals such as Emperor Vespasian, Muhammad, and even Napoleon, and the angel was generally regarded as “satanic.” It should be noted, however, that at Revelation 20:1-3 the angel having “the key of the abyss” is shown to be God’s representative from heaven, and rather than being “satanic,” he binds and hurls Satan into the abyss. Commenting on Revelation 9:11, The Interpreter’s Bible says: “Abaddon, however, is an angel not of Satan but of God, performing his work of destruction at God’s bidding.”
In the Hebrew scriptures just considered, it is evident that ʼavad·dohnʹ is paralleled with Sheol and death. At Revelation 1:18 we find Christ Jesus stating: “I am living forever and ever, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.” His power with regard to the abyss is shown at Luke 8:31. That he has destroying power, including the power of destruction over Satan, is evident from Hebrews 2:14, which says that Jesus partook of blood and flesh in order that “through his death he might bring to nothing the one having the means to cause death, that is, the Devil.” At Revelation 19:11-16 he is clearly represented as God’s appointed Destroyer or Executioner.—See APOLLYON.

===Gnostic texts===
In the 3rd century [[Acts of Thomas]], Abaddon is the name of a demon, or the [[devil]] himself.

Abaddon is given particularly important roles in two sources, a homily entitled "The Enthronement of Abbaton" by pseudo-[[Timothy of Alexandria]], and the [[Resurrection of Jesus Christ (by Bartholomew)|Apocalypse of Bartholomew]].<ref name=Aziz>{{cite book|last1=Atiya|first1=Aziz S.|title=The Coptic Encyclopedia|date=1991|publisher=Macmillan [u.a.]|location=New York|isbn=0-02-897025-X}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=March 2016}} In the homily by Timothy, Abbaton was first named ''Muriel'', and had been given the task by [[God]] of collecting the earth that would be used in the creation of [[Adam]]. Upon completion of this task, the angel was appointed as a guardian. Everyone, including the angels, demons, and corporeal entities feared him. Abbaton was promised that any who venerated him in life could be saved. Abaddon is also said to have a prominent role in the [[Last Judgement]], as the one who will take the souls to the [[Valley of Josaphat]].<ref name=Aziz/> He is described in the Apocalypse of Bartholomew as being present in the [[Tomb of Jesus]] at the moment of his [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/LostBooks/bartholomew.htm |title=Gospel Of Bartholomew |publisher=Pseudepigrapha.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-03}}</ref>
