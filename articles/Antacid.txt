An '''antacid''' is a substance which [[neutralization (chemistry)|neutralizes]] [[gastric acid|stomach acidity]], which in turn relieves [[heartburn]], [[indigestion]] or stomach upset.<ref name="Overview">Internal Clinical Guidelines Team (UK).

Antacids are available [[over the counter]] and are taken by mouth to quickly relieve occasional [[heartburn]], the major symptom of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] and also [[indigestion]]. Treatment with antacids alone is [[Symptomatic treatment|symptomatic]] and only justified for minor symptoms.<ref name=AHRQ>U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 23 September 2011 [http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/search-for-guides-reviews-and-reports/?pageaction=displayproduct&productID=756 Consumer Summary â€“ Treatment Options for GERD or Acid Reflux Disease: A Review of the Research for Adults]</ref>

Antacids are distinct from acid-reducing drugs like [[H2 antagonist|H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist]]s or [[proton pump inhibitor]]s and they do not kill the bacteria ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', which causes most [[gastric ulcer|ulcers]].<ref name=AHRQ/>

==Side effects==
Versions with magnesium may cause diarrhoea, and brands with calcium or aluminium may cause constipation and rarely, long-term use may cause kidney stones. Long-term use of versions with aluminium may increase the risk for getting [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=MedlinePlus>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, U.S. National Library of Medicine.

==Mechanism of action==
When excessive amounts of acids are produced in the stomach the natural mucous barrier that protects the lining of the stomach can damage the esophagus in people with [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|acid reflux]]. Antacids contain [[alkaline]] ions that [[Neutralization (chemistry)|chemically neutralize]] stomach [[gastric acid]], reducing damage and relieving pain.<ref name="Overview"/>

==Formulations==
Antacids may be formulated with other [[active pharmaceutical ingredient|active ingredients]] like [[simethicone]] to control [[Flatulence|gas]] or [[alginic acid]] to act as a physical barrier to acid.<ref>IFFGD.
