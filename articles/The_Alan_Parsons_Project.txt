'''The Alan Parsons Project''' were a British [[progressive rock]] band, active between 1975 and 1990,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alanparsonsmusic.com/bio.php |title=Alan Parsons – Bio FAQ Discography |publisher=Alanparsonsmusic.com |date= |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> consisting of [[Alan Parsons]] and [[Eric Woolfson]] surrounded by a varying number of session musicians and some relatively consistent band members such as guitarist [[Ian Bairnson]], bassist and vocalist [[David Paton]], drummer [[Stuart Elliott (drummer)|Stuart Elliott]], and vocalist [[Lenny Zakatek]].

Behind the revolving line-up and the regular sidemen, the true core of the Project was the duo of Parsons and Woolfson. Parsons was an audio engineer by profession, but also a musician and a composer. A songwriter by profession, Woolfson was also a composer, a pianist, and a singer. Almost all songs on the band's albums are credited to "Parsons/Woolfson".

==Career==
===1974–1976: Formation and debut ===
[[Alan Parsons]] met [[Eric Woolfson]] in the [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] of [[Abbey Road Studios]] in the summer of 1974. Parsons had already acted as Assistant Engineer on [[the Beatles]]' albums ''[[Abbey Road]]'' and ''[[Let It Be (The Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'', had recently engineered [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', and had produced several acts for EMI Records.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book

When Parsons asked Woolfson to become his manager, he accepted and subsequently managed Parsons' career as a producer and engineer through a string of successes, including [[Pilot (band)|Pilot]], [[Steve Harley]], [[Cockney Rebel]], [[John Miles (musician)|John Miles]], [[Al Stewart]], [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]] and [[the Hollies]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Parsons commented at the time that he felt frustrated in having to accommodate the views of some of the musicians, which he felt interfered with his production. Woolfson came up with the idea of making an album based on developments in the [[film industry]], where directors such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Stanley Kubrick]] were the focal point of the film's promotion, rather than individual film stars. If the film industry was becoming a director's medium, Woolfson felt the music business might well become a producer's medium.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Recalling his earlier Edgar Allan Poe material, Woolfson saw a way to combine his and Parsons' respective talents. Parsons would produce and engineer songs written by the two, and the Alan Parsons Project was born. Their first album, ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Alan Parsons Project album)|Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'' released by [[20th Century Fox Records]], including major contributions by all members of Pilot and [[Ambrosia (band)|Ambrosia]], was a success, reaching the [[Top 40]] in the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] [[record chart|chart]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The song "[[The Raven (song)|The Raven]]" featured lead vocals by the actor [[Leonard Whiting]], and, according to the 2007 remastered album liner notes, was the first rock song to use a [[Digital data|digital]] [[vocoder]], with Alan Parsons speaking [[lyrics]] through it.

The complete Alan Parsons Project's history was finally compiled and released as an English language book in December 2016, when "The Alan Parsons Project — The Eye In The Sky", written by Francesco Ferrua, was published by the Italian editor Arcana. It is a translation of the book, from the same author, originally published in March 2015 in Italian language — the first book in the world ever released about The Alan Parsons Project.<ref name="The Eye In The Sky">{{cite book

===1977–1990: Mainstream success and final releases ===

[[Arista Records]] then signed the Alan Parsons Project for further albums. Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, the group's popularity continued to grow (although they were always more popular in North America, Ibero America and [[Continental Europe]] than in their home country, never achieving a UK Top 40 single or Top 20 album). The [[single (music)|singles]] "[[I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You]]", "[[Games People Play (Alan Parsons Project song)|Games People Play]]", "Damned If I Do", "Time" (Woolfson's first lead vocal) and "[[Eye in the Sky (song)|Eye in the Sky]]" had a notable impact on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. "[[Don't Answer Me]]" became their last successful single in the United States; it reached the top 15 on the American charts in 1984. After those successes, however, the group began to fade from view. There were fewer hit singles, and declining album sales. 1987's ''[[Gaudi (The Alan Parsons Project album)|Gaudi]]'' would be the Project's final release, though they planned to record an album called ''[[Freudiana]]'' next.

====The musical "Freudiana"====
Although the studio version of ''Freudiana'' was produced by Parsons (and featured the regular Project backing musicians, making it an 'unofficial' Project album), it was primarily Woolfson's idea to turn it into a musical. This eventually led to a rift between the two artists. While Parsons pursued his own solo career and took many members of the Project on the road for the first time in a successful worldwide tour, Woolfson went on to produce musical plays influenced by the Project's music. ''[[Freudiana]]'', ''Gaudi'' and ''Gambler'' were three musicals that included some Project songs like "Eye in the Sky", "Time", "Inside Looking Out", and "Limelight". The live music from ''Gambler'' was only distributed at the performance site in [[Mönchengladbach]], Germany.

===="The Sicilian Defence"====
In 1981,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadkill.com/~ajy/scrapbook/001.html |title=Roadkill.com |publisher=Roadkill.com |date= |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> Parsons, Woolfson and their [[record label]] Arista, had been stalled in contract renegotiations when on March 5, the two submitted an all-instrumental album tentatively titled "The Sicilian Defence" (the name of an [[Sicilian Defence|aggressive opening move]] in chess), arguably to get out of their [[recording contract]]. Arista's refusal to release the album had two known effects: the negotiations led to a renewed contract, and the album was not released at that time.

{{quote|''The Sicilian Defence'' was our attempt at quickly fulfilling our contractual obligation after ''I Robot'', ''Pyramid'' and ''Eve'' had been delivered. The album was rejected by Arista, not surprisingly, and we then renegotiated our deal for the future and the next album, ''The Turn of a Friendly Card''. The Sicilian Defence album was never released and never will be, if I have anything to do with it. I have not heard it since it was finished. I hope the tapes no longer exist.|Alan Parsons<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alanparsonsmusic.com/interviews.php |title=Alanparsonsmusic.com |publisher=Alanparsonsmusic.com |date=20 December 1948 |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref>}}

In interviews made before his 2009 death,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/EricWoolfson?v=feed&story_fbid=192291343290 |title=Eric Woolfson on Facebook |publisher=Facebook.com |date= |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> Woolfson said he planned to release one track from the "Sicilian" album, which in 2008 appeared as a bonus track on a CD re-issue of the ''[[Eve (The Alan Parsons Project album)|Eve]]'' album. Sometime later after finding the original tapes, Alan had changed his mind about the album and announced that it would finally be released on an upcoming Project box set called "The Complete Albums Collection" in 2014 for the first time as a bonus disc.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/02/14/alan-parsons-project-tour-on-the-road-again/1914601/|title=Alan Parsons on the road again|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=8 June 2013|first=Brian|last=Mansfield|date=14 February 2013}}</ref>

==Alan Parsons' solo career==
Parsons released titles under his name (''[[Try Anything Once]]'', ''[[On Air (Alan Parsons album)|On Air]]'', ''[[The Time Machine (Alan Parsons album)|The Time Machine]]'', and ''[[A Valid Path]]''), while Woolfson made [[concept album]]s named ''[[Freudiana]]'' (about [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work on [[psychology]]) and ''[[Poe: More Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]'' (continuing from the Alan Parsons Project's first album about Edgar Allan Poe's literature).

''Tales of Mystery and Imagination'' was first [[remix]]ed in 1987 for release on CD, and included narration by [[Orson Welles]] which had been recorded in 1975, but arrived too late to be included on the original album. On the 2007 deluxe edition release, it is revealed that parts of this tape were used for the 1976 Griffith Park Planetarium launch of the original album, the 1987 remix, and various radio spots, all of which were included as bonus material.

== Sound ==
Most of the Project's titles, especially the early work, share common traits (likely influenced by [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', on which Parsons was the [[audio engineer]] in 1973). They were [[concept album]]s and typically began with an [[instrumental]] introduction, which faded into the first song, often had an instrumental piece in the middle of the second [[gramophone record|LP]] side, and concluded with a quiet, melancholic, or powerful song. The opening instrumental was largely done away with by 1980; no later Project album except ''[[Eye in the Sky (album)|Eye in the Sky]]'' featured one (although every album includes at least one instrumental somewhere in the running order). The instrumental on that album, "[[Sirius (instrumental)|Sirius]]", eventually became the best-known (or at least most frequently heard) Parsons instrumental. It was used as entrance music by various American sports teams, most notably by the [[Chicago Bulls]] during their 1990s [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] [[dynasty (sports)|dynasty]]. It was also used as the entrance theme for [[Ricky Steamboat]] in pro wrestling of the mid-1980s. In addition, Sirius has been played in a variety of TV shows and movies including the episode "Vanishing Act" of ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'' and the 2009 film ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)]]''.

The group was notable for using several vocal performers instead of having a single lead vocalist. Lead vocal duties were shared by guest vocalists chosen by their vocal style to complement each song. In later years, Woolfson sang lead on many of the group's hits (including "Time", "Eye in the Sky" and "Don't Answer Me"); however, he did not sing any lead vocals on the band's first four albums and appeared as vocalist only sporadically thereafter.  When the Woolfson-sung songs became significant hits, the record company pressured Parsons to use him more. However, Parsons preferred to use more technically polished and proficient singers, which Woolfson admitted he was not. In addition to Woolfson, vocalists [[Chris Rainbow]], [[Lenny Zakatek]], [[John Miles (musician)|John Miles]], [[David Paton]] and [[the Zombies]]' [[Colin Blunstone]] made regular appearances.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Other singers, such as [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], Steve Harley, [[Procol Harum]]'s [[Gary Brooker]], [[Elmer Gantry’s Velvet Opera|Dave Terry a.k.a. Elmer Gantry]], [[Vitamin Z]]'s Geoff Barradale and [[Marmalade (band)|Marmalade]]'s Dean Ford, have recorded only once or twice with the Project. Parsons himself only sang lead on one song ("[[The Raven (song)|The Raven]]") through a [[vocoder]] and can be heard singing backing vocals on a few others, including "To One in Paradise". Both of those songs appeared on ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Alan Parsons Project album)|Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]''.

Although the vocalists varied, a small number of musicians worked with the Alan Parsons Project regularly. These core musicians contributed to the recognisable style of a Project song in spite of the varied singer line-up. Together with Parsons and Woolfson, the Project originally consisted of the group Pilot, with [[Ian Bairnson]] (guitar), [[David Paton]] (bass) and [[Stuart Tosh]] (drums).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Pilot's keyboardist [[Billy Lyall]] also contributed. From ''Pyramid'' onwards, Tosh was replaced by [[Stuart Elliott (drummer)|Stuart Elliott]] of [[Cockney Rebel]]. Bairnson played on all albums, and Paton stayed almost until the end. [[Andrew Powell]] appeared as arranger of orchestra (and often choirs) on all albums except ''Vulture Culture'', when he was composing the [[film score|score]] of [[Richard Donner]]'s film ''[[Ladyhawke (film)|Ladyhawke]]''. This score was partly in the Project style, recorded by most of the Project regulars, and produced and engineered by Parsons. Powell also composed some material for the first two Project albums. From ''Vulture Culture'' onwards, Richard Cottle played as a regular member on synthesizers and saxophone.

[[File:Alan Parsons live.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Alan Parsons Live Project, June 1998 (distinct from the Alan Parsons Project live)]]
Except for one occasion, the Project never played live during its original incarnation. This was because Woolfson and Parsons saw themselves mainly in the roles of writing and production, and also because of the technical difficulties of reproducing on stage the complex instrumentation used in the studio. In the 1990s things changed with the technology of [[digital sampler]]s. The one occasion where the band was introduced as "The Alan Parsons Project" in a live performance was at [[Night of the Proms]] 1990 (at the time of the group's break-up), featuring all Project regulars except Woolfson who was present but behind the scenes, while Parsons stayed at the mixer except during the last song, where he played acoustic guitar.

Since 1993, a new version of the band has toured, with Parsons performing live acoustic guitar, keyboards and vocals, with various line-ups. This latest incarnation was called '''Alan Parsons''', eventually renaming as the '''Alan Parsons Live Project''', the name distinct from "The Alan Parsons Project", due to founder Parsons' break-up with Woolfson. The band currently features lead singer P.J. Olsson, guitarist Alastair Greene, drummer Danny Thompson, keyboardist Manny Focarazzo, keyboardist Tom Brooks, bass guitarist Guy Erez, vocalist and saxophonist Todd Cooper, and guitarist and vocalist Dan Tracey.In 2013, Alan Parsons Live Project played [[Colombia]] with a full choir and orchestra (the [[Medellin]] Philharmonic) as ''Alan Parsons Symphonic Project''. A 2-CD live set and a DVD version of this concert were released in May 2016.
