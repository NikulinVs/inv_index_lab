'''Arsenal Football Club''' is an [[England|English]] professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Highbury]], [[London]], that plays in the [[Premier League]], the top flight of English football. The club [[Football records in England#Total titles won (1871–present)|has won]] 12 [[FA Cup]]s, a joint-record, 13 [[List of English football champions#Total titles won|League titles]], two [[EFL Cup|League Cups]], 14 [[FA Community Shield]]s, one [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] and one [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]].

Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join [[The Football League]], in 1893. They entered the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1904, and have since accumulated the second most points.<ref name="All Time Table">{{cite web|title=English Premier League : Full All Time Table|url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/premier-league/all-time-table/full|website=statto.com|accessdate=21 January 2016}}</ref> Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division.<ref name="RSSSF_Div_Movements">{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=James|last2=Heneghan|first2=Michael|last3=Orford|first3=Stuart|last4=Culliton|first4=Eoin|title=English Clubs Divisional Movements 1888–2016|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engall.html|website=www.rsssf.com|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]|accessdate=5 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805092856/http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engall.html |archivedate=5 August 2016|date=23 June 2016|dead-url=no}}</ref> In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In [[1970–71 in English football|1970–71]], they won their first [[Double (association football)#England|League and FA Cup Double]]. Between 1989 and 2005, they won five League titles and five FA Cups, including two more Doubles.

[[Herbert Chapman]] won Arsenal's first national trophies, but died prematurely.

[[Arsène Wenger]] has been the longest-serving manager and has won the most trophies. His teams set several English records: the longest win streak; the longest unbeaten run; and [[2003–04 Arsenal F.C. season|the only]] 38 match season [[The Invincibles (football)|unbeaten]].

In 1886, [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich munitions]] workers founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913, the club crossed the city to [[Arsenal Stadium]] in [[Highbury]]. They became [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]'s nearest club, commencing the [[North London derby]]. In 2006, they moved down the road to the [[Emirates Stadium]].

[[File:Arsenal 1888 squad photo.jpg|thumb|Royal Arsenal squad in 1888. Original captain, [[David Danskin]], sits on the right of the bench.]]

On 1 December 1886, munitions workers in [[Woolwich]], now South East London, formed Arsenal as Dial Square, with [[David Danskin]] as their first captain.<ref>Woolwich and Plumstead were officially part of [[Kent]] until the creation of the [[County of London]] in 1889.

Royal Arsenal renamed themselves for a second time upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893. They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with [[The Football League]] when the club ascended later that year.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Andy|last2=Andrews|first2=Mark|title=How Arsenal’s Name Changed – Woolwich Arsenal|url=http://www.thearsenalhistory.com/?p=7728|website=The Arsenal History|accessdate=11 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205024313/http://www.thearsenalhistory.com/?p=7728|archivedate=5 February 2016|date=20 January 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|Attwood|Kelly|Andrews|2012|ps=.

Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Sally|title=Woolwich Arsenal 1910 – the arrival of Hall and Norris|url=http://www.wrightanddavis.co.uk/Norris/SLWA10.html|website=www.wrightanddavis.co.uk|accessdate=11 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410074122/http://www.wrightanddavis.co.uk/Norris/SLWA10.html |archivedate=10 April 2016|date=December 2007}}</ref>{{sfn|Attwood|Kelly|Andrews|2012|ps=.

In 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Woolwich Arsenal moved to the new [[Arsenal Stadium]] in [[Highbury]], North London. This saw their third change of name: the following year, they reduced Woolwich Arsenal to simply The Arsenal.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Andy|last2=Andrews|first2=Mark|title=How Arsenal’s Name Changed – The Arsenal|url=http://www.thearsenalhistory.com/?p=7730|website=The Arsenal History|accessdate=11 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213131650/http://thearsenalhistory.com/?p=7730|archivedate=13 February 2014|date=26 January 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|Attwood|Kelly|Andrews|2012|ps=. ''Woolwich Arsenal FC: 1893–1915 The club that changed football''|pp=43–64}} In 1919, The Football League voted to promote The Arsenal, instead of relegated local rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], into the [[1919–20 Football League|newly enlarged]] First Division, despite only listing the club sixth in the Second Division's last pre-war season of [[1914–15 Football League#Second Division|1914–15]]. Some books have speculated that the club won this election to division one by dubious means.<ref>It has been alleged that Arsenal's promotion, on historical grounds rather than merit, was thanks to underhand actions by Norris, who was chairman of the club at the time; see [[History of Arsenal F.C. (1886–1966)]] for more details. This speculation ranges from political machinations to outright bribery; no evidence of any wrongdoing has ever been found.

==Crest==
[[File:Arsenal crest 1888.png|thumb|right|Arsenal's first crest from 1888]]

Unveiled in 1888, Royal Arsenal's first [[crest (sports)|crest]] featured three [[cannon]]<nowiki/>s viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich]] (nowadays transferred to the [[coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Greenwich]]). These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys, but the presence of a carved lion's head and a [[cascabel (artillery)|cascabel]] on each are clear indicators that they are cannons.<ref name="crest">{{cite web | url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/the-crest | title=The Crest | publisher=Arsenal F.C | accessdate=11 August 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080812085724/http://www.arsenal.com/history/the-crest| archivedate= 12 August 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> This was dropped after the move to Highbury in 1913, only to be reinstated in 1922, when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon, pointing eastwards, with the club's nickname, ''The Gunners'', inscribed alongside it; this crest only lasted until 1925, when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down.<ref name="crest"/>

In 1949, the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon below the club's name, set in [[blackletter]], and above the coat of arms of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Islington]] and a scroll inscribed with the club's newly adopted Latin [[motto]], ''Victoria Concordia Crescit -'' "victory comes from harmony" – coined by the club's programme editor Harry Homer.<ref name="crest"/> For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour, which varied slightly over the crest's lifespan, finally becoming red, gold and green. Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal were unable to [[copyright]] it. Although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark, and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold "unofficial" Arsenal merchandise,<ref>{{cite web

The monogram theme was developed into an [[Art Deco]]-style badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F, the whole set within a hexagonal border. This early example of a corporate logo, introduced as part of Herbert Chapman's rebranding of the club in the 1930s, was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium, including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors.<ref name="artdeco">{{cite web

In the 2011–12 season, Arsenal celebrated their 125th year anniversary. The celebrations included a modified version of the current crest worn on their jerseys for the season. The crest was all white, surrounded by 15 [[oak]] leaves to the right and 15 [[Laurel wreath|laurel]] leaves to the left. The oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the Royal Oak pub. The 15 laurel leaves represent the design detail on the six pence pieces paid by the founding fathers to establish the club. The laurel leaves also represent strength. To complete the crest, 1886 and 2011 are shown on either sides of the motto "Forward" at the bottom of the crest.<ref name="125th anniversary crest">{{cite web

For much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, [[Fred Beardsley]] and [[Morris Bates]], were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball.{{sfn|Soar|Tyler|2011|ps=.

In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter [[pillar box]] red. Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist [[Tom Webster (cartoonist)|Tom Webster]], with whom Chapman played golf.<ref name="kitdesign">{{cite web

Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts;<ref name="historicalkits" /> this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season.<ref name="kitdesign"/> In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe.<ref name="historicalkits" />

Arsenal's home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs. In 1909, [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time;<ref name="kitdesign"/> in 1938, [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip.<ref>{{cite web

For many years Arsenal's away colours were white shirts and either black or white shorts. In the 1969–70 season, Arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts. This kit was worn in the [[1971 FA Cup Final]] as Arsenal beat Liverpool to secure the [[Double (association football)|double]] for the first time in their history.<ref name=cupfinal>{{cite news|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/index.html|title=FA Cup Finals|accessdate=4 October 2013|work=Historical Football Kits}}</ref> Arsenal reached the [[1972 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] again the following year wearing the red and white home strip and were beaten by [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]].

The following season, Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme, albeit with a darker shade of blue than before.

When [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] took over from [[Adidas]] as Arsenal's kit provider in 1994, Arsenal's away colours were again changed to two-tone blue shirts and shorts. Since the advent of the lucrative replica kit market, the away kits have been changed regularly, with Arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits. During this period the designs have been either all blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001–02 season, the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007, and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013.<ref>{{cite web

==Stadiums==
{{Main article|Emirates Stadium}}
[[File:Manor Ground, Woolwich Arsenal vs. Everton.jpg|thumb|left|[[Manor Ground (Plumstead)|Manor Ground]], Woolwich Arsenal vs. [[Everton F.C.]]]]
For most of their time in south-east London, Arsenal played at the [[Manor Ground, Plumstead|Manor Ground]] in [[Plumstead]], apart from a three-year period at the nearby [[Invicta Ground]] between 1890 and 1893. The Manor Ground was initially just a field, until the club installed stands and [[terrace (stadium)|terracing]] for their first Football League match in September 1893. They played their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.<ref>{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Inglis |title=Football Grounds of Britain |origyear=1985 |edition=3rd |year=1996 |publisher=CollinsWillow |location=London |isbn=0-00-218426-5 |pages=16–17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Suspension of the Plumstead Ground |newspaper=The Times |date=7 February 1895 |page=6}}</ref>

Widely referred to as Highbury, [[Arsenal Stadium]] was the club's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing.<ref name="conservation_plan"/> The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new [[Art Deco]] West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.<ref name="conservation_plan"/>

Highbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The [[Taylor Report]] and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators.<ref>{{cite web

[[File:Arsenal Stadium interior North Bank.jpg|thumb|right|The North Bank Stand, [[Arsenal Stadium]], [[Highbury]]|alt=A grandstand at a sports stadium. The seats are predominantly red.]]
Expansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II [[listed building]] and the other three stands were close to residential properties.<ref name="conservation_plan"/> These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time.<ref>{{cite news

Like all major English football clubs, Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters' clubs, including the Arsenal Football Supporters' Club, which works closely with the club, and the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association, which maintains a more independent line. The [[Arsenal Supporters' Trust]] promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans. The club's supporters also publish [[fanzine]]s such as ''The Gooner'', ''Gunflash'' and the satirical ''Up The Arse!''. In addition to the usual English [[football chant]]s, supporters sing "One-Nil to the Arsenal" (to the tune of "[[Go West (song)|Go West]]").

There have always been Arsenal supporters outside London, and since the advent of satellite television, a supporter's attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography. Consequently, Arsenal have a significant number of fans from beyond London and all over the world; in 2007, 24 UK, 37 Irish and 49 other overseas supporters clubs were affiliated with the club.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.arsenal.com/assets/_files/documents/jul_08/gun__1215526755_charter_report_20062007.doc |format=Word document | title=Fans Report 2006/2007 | publisher=Arsenal F.C | accessdate=7 September 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080910062129/http://www.arsenal.com/assets/_files/documents/jul_08/gun__1215526755_charter_report_20062007.doc| archivedate= 10 September 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> A 2011 report by SPORT+MARKT estimated Arsenal's global fanbase at 113 million.<ref name="SPORT+MARKT analysis">{{cite web|last1=O’Connor|first1=Ashling|title=Liverpool lag in fight for global fan supremacy as TV row grows|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/premierleague/article3192868.ece|website=thetimes.co.uk|publisher=The Times|accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref> The club's social media activity was the fifth highest in world football during the 2014–15 season.<ref name="Deloitte Football Money League" />
