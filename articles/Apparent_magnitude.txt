The '''apparent magnitude''' ('''{{mvar|m}}''') of a [[celestial object]] is a number that is a measure of its [[brightness]] as seen by an observer on Earth. The brighter an object appears, the lower its [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] value (i.e. inverse relation). The Sun, at apparent magnitude of −27, is the brightest object in the sky. It is adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Furthermore, the magnitude scale is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]; a difference of one in magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of {{radic|100|5}}, or about 2.512.

Generally, the [[visible spectrum]] ({{mvar|m<sub>v</sub>}}) is used as a basis for the apparent magnitude. However, other spectra are also used (e.g. the [[near-infrared]] [[J band (infrared)|J band]]). In the visible spectrum, [[Sirius]] is the brightest star after the [[Sun]]. In the near-infrared J-band, [[Betelgeuse]] is the brightest. The apparent magnitude of stars is measured with a [[bolometer]].

The scale used to indicate magnitude originates in the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] practice of dividing stars visible to the naked eye into six ''magnitudes''. The [[List of brightest stars|brightest stars]] in the night sky were said to be of [[first magnitude star|first magnitude]] ({{mvar|m}} = 1), whereas the faintest were of sixth magnitude ({{mvar|m}} = 6), which is the limit of [[human]] [[visual perception]] (without the aid of a [[telescope]]). Each grade of magnitude was considered twice the brightness of the following grade (a [[logarithmic scale]]), although that ratio was subjective as no [[photodetector]]s existed. This rather crude scale for the brightness of stars was popularized by [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'', and is generally believed to have originated with [[Hipparchus]].

In 1856, [[Norman Robert Pogson]] formalized the system by defining a first magnitude star as a star that is 100 times as bright as a sixth-magnitude star, thereby establishing the [[logarithmic scale]] still in use today. This implies that a star of magnitude {{mvar|m}} is 2.512 times as bright as a star of magnitude {{math|''m'' + 1}}. This figure, the [[Generalized continued fraction#Example 2|fifth root of 100]], became known as Pogson's Ratio.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0017//0000012.000.html |title=Magnitudes of Thirty-six of the Minor Planets for the first day of each month of the year 1857 |authorlink=Norman Robert Pogson |first=N. |last=Pogson |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|MNRAS]] |volume=17 |page=12 |date=1856}}</ref> The zero point of Pogson's scale was originally defined by assigning [[Polaris]] a magnitude of exactly 2. Astronomers later discovered that Polaris is slightly variable, so they switched to [[Vega]] as the standard reference star, assigning the brightness of Vega as the definition of zero magnitude at any specified wavelength.

Apart from small corrections, the brightness of Vega still serves as the definition of zero magnitude for visible and [[Infrared#ISO 20473 scheme|near infrared]] wavelengths, where its [[spectral energy distribution]] (SED) closely approximates that of a [[black body]] for a temperature of {{val|11000|u=K}}. However, with the advent of [[infrared astronomy]] it was revealed that Vega's radiation includes an [[Infrared excess]] presumably due to a [[circumstellar disk]] consisting of [[Cosmic dust|dust]] at warm temperatures (but much cooler than the star's surface). At shorter (e.g. visible) wavelengths, there is negligible emission from dust at these temperatures. However, in order to properly extend the magnitude scale further into the infrared, this peculiarity of Vega should not affect the definition of the magnitude scale. Therefore, the magnitude scale was extrapolated to ''all'' wavelengths on the basis of the [[Planck's law|black body radiation curve]] for an ideal stellar surface at {{val|11000|u=K}} uncontaminated by circumstellar radiation. On this basis the [[spectral irradiance]] (usually expressed in [[jansky]]s) for the zero magnitude point, as a function of wavelength can be computed.<ref>See [http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~patton/astro/mags.html#flux].</ref> Small deviations are specified between systems using measurement apparatuses developed independently so that data obtained by different astronomers can be properly compared; of greater practical importance is the definition of magnitude not at a single wavelength but applying to the response of standard spectral filters used in [[Photometry (astronomy)#methods|photometry]] over various wavelength bands.

With the modern magnitude systems, brightness over a very wide range is specified according to the logarithmic definition detailed below, using this zero reference. In practice such apparent magnitudes do not exceed 30 (for detectable measurements). The brightness of Vega is exceeded by four stars in the night sky at visible wavelengths (and more at infrared wavelengths) as well as bright planets such as Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and these must be described by ''negative'' magnitudes. For example, [[Sirius]], the brightest star of the [[celestial sphere]], has an apparent magnitude of −1.4 in the visible; negative magnitudes for other very bright astronomical objects can be found in the [[#Table of notable celestial objects|table]] below.

== Calculations ==
[[File:VISTA Magellanic Cloud Survey view of the Tarantula Nebula.jpg|thumb|[[30 Doradus]] image taken by [[ESO]]'s [[VISTA (telescope)|VISTA]]. This [[nebula]] has an apparent magnitude of 8.]]

As the amount of light actually received by a telescope is reduced by transmission through the [[Earth's atmosphere]], any measurement of  apparent magnitude is [[Photometry (astronomy)#Calibrations|corrected]] for what it would have been as seen from above the atmosphere. The dimmer an object appears, the higher the numerical value given to its apparent magnitude, with a difference of 5 magnitudes corresponding to a brightness factor of exactly 100. Therefore, the apparent magnitude {{mvar|m}}, in the [[Photometric system|spectral band]] {{mvar|x}}, would be given by:

:<math>m_{x}= -5 \log_{100} \left(\frac {F_x}{F_{x,0} }\right)</math>

which is more commonly expressed in terms of [[Common logarithm|common (base 10) logarithms]] as:

:<math>m_{x} = -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac {F_x}{F_{x,0} }\right) \,,</math>

where {{mvar|F<sub>x</sub>}} is the observed [[flux]] using spectral filter {{mvar|x}}, and {{math|''F''<sub>''x'',0</sub>}} is the reference flux (zero-point) for that [[Photometric system#Filters used|photometric filter]].  Since an increase of 5 magnitudes corresponds to a decrease in brightness by a factor of exactly 100, each magnitude increase implies a decrease in brightness by the factor {{radic|100|5}} ≈&nbsp;2.512 (Pogson's Ratio). Inverting the above formula, a magnitude difference {{math|''m''<sub>1</sub> − ''m''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} Δ''m''}} implies a brightness factor of

:<math> \frac{F_2}{F_1} = 100^\frac{\Delta m}{5} = 10^{0.4 \Delta m} \approx 2.512^{\Delta m} \,.</math>

=== Example: Sun and Moon ===
''What is the ratio in brightness between the [[Sun]] and the full [[Moon]]?''

The apparent magnitude of the Sun is −26.74 (brighter), and the mean apparent magnitude of the full moon is −12.74 (dimmer).

Difference in magnitude: 
:<math> x = m_1 - m_2 = (-12.74) - (-26.74) = 14.00 </math>

Brightness factor: 
:<math> v_b = 10^{0.4 x} = 10^{0.4\times 14.00} \approx 398\,107.17 </math>

The Sun appears about {{val|400000}} times brighter than the full moon.

===Magnitude addition===
Sometimes one might wish to add brightnesses. For example, [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] on closely separated [[double star]]s may only be able to produce a measurement of their combined light output. How would we reckon the combined magnitude of that double star knowing only the magnitudes of the individual components? This can be done by adding the brightnesses (in linear units) corresponding to each magnitude.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnitude Arithmetic|url=http://www.caglow.com/info/wtopic/mag-arith|work=Weekly Topic|publisher=Caglow|accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref>
:<math> 10^{-m_f\times 0.4} = 10^{-m_1\times 0.4} + 10^{-m_2\times 0.4} \,. </math>

Solving for <math>m_f</math> yields
:<math> m_f = -2.5\log_{10} \left(10^{-m_1\times 0.4} + 10^{-m_2\times 0.4} \right) \,. </math>

where {{mvar|m<sub>f</sub>}} is the resulting magnitude after adding the brightnesses referred to by {{math|''m''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''m''<sub>2</sub>}}.

===Absolute magnitude===
{{main|Absolute magnitude}}
Since flux decreases with distance according to the [[inverse-square law]], a particular apparent magnitude could equally well refer to a star at one distance, or a star four times brighter at twice that distance, and so on. When one is not interested in the brightness as viewed from Earth, but the ''intrinsic'' brightness of an astronomical object, then one refers not to the apparent magnitude but the [[absolute magnitude]]. The absolute magnitude {{mvar|M}}, of a star or astronomical object is defined as the apparent magnitude it would have as seen from a distance of 10 [[parsec]]s (about 32.6 [[light years]]). The absolute magnitude of the Sun is 4.83 in the V band (yellow) and 5.48 in the B band (blue).<ref name="Bband">{{cite web

It is important to note that the scale is [[logarithm]]ic: the relative brightness of two objects is determined by the difference of their magnitudes. For example, a difference of 3.2 means that one object is about 19 times as bright as the other, because [[Apparent magnitude#History|Pogson's Ratio]] raised to the power 3.2 is approximately 19.05.

A common misconception is that the logarithmic nature of the scale is because the [[human eye]] itself has a logarithmic response. In Pogson's time this was thought to be true (see [[Weber–Fechner law]]), but it is now believed that the response is a [[power law]] (see [[Stevens' power law]]).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Misconceptions About Astronomical Magnitudes|authorlink=Eric Schulman|first1=E.|last1=Schulman|first2=C. V.|last2=Cox|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=65|page=1003|date=1997|bibcode = 1997AmJPh..65.1003S |doi = 10.1119/1.18714 }}</ref>

Magnitude is complicated by the fact that light is not [[monochromatic]]. The sensitivity of a light detector varies according to the wavelength of the light, and the way it varies depends on the type of light detector. For this reason, it is necessary to specify how the magnitude is measured for the value to be meaningful. For this purpose the [[UBV system]] is widely used, in which the magnitude is measured in three different wavelength bands: U (centred at about 350&nbsp;nm, in the near [[ultraviolet]]), B (about 435&nbsp;nm, in the blue region) and V (about 555&nbsp;nm, in the middle of the human visual range in daylight). The V band was chosen for spectral purposes and gives magnitudes closely corresponding to those seen by the light-adapted human eye, and when an apparent magnitude is given without any further qualification, it is usually the V magnitude that is meant, more or less the same as '''visual magnitude'''.

Because cooler stars, such as [[red giant]]s and [[red dwarf]]s, emit little energy in the blue and UV regions of the spectrum their power is often under-represented by the UBV scale. Indeed, some [[stellar classification|L and T class]] stars have an estimated magnitude of well over 100, because they emit extremely little visible light, but are strongest in [[infrared]].

Measures of magnitude need cautious treatment and it is extremely important to measure like with like. On early 20th century and older orthochromatic (blue-sensitive) [[photographic film]], the relative brightnesses of the blue [[supergiant]] [[Rigel]] and the red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] irregular variable star (at maximum) are reversed compared to what human eyes perceive, because this archaic film is more sensitive to blue light than it is to red light. Magnitudes obtained from this method are known as [[photographic magnitude]]s, and are now considered obsolete.

For objects within the [[Milky Way]] with a given [[absolute magnitude]], 5 is added to the apparent magnitude for every tenfold increase in the distance to the object. This relationship does not apply for objects at very great distances (far beyond the Milky Way), because a correction for [[general relativity]] must then be taken into account due to the non-Euclidean nature of space. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

For planets and other Solar System bodies the apparent magnitude is derived from its [[Phase curve (astronomy)|phase curve]] and the distances to the Sun and observer.
