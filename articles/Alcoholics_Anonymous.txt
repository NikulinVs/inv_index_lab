'''Alcoholics Anonymous''' ('''AA''') is an international [[Social work with groups#Mutual aid|mutual aid]] fellowship<ref>http://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/smf-92_en.pdf</ref> founded in 1935 by [[Bill W.|Bill Wilson]] and [[Bob Smith (doctor)|Dr. Bob Smith]] in [[Akron, Ohio]]. AA's stated "primary purpose" is to help [[alcoholics]] "stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve [[sobriety]]".<ref>{{cite journal|title=none|author=Michael Gross |journal=American Journal of Public Health|year=2010|issue=December 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aa.org/en_pdfs/smf-92_en.pdf AA.org]</ref><ref>Mäkelä 1996, p. 3</ref> With other early members Bill Wilson and Bob Smith developed AA's [[the Twelve Steps|Twelve Step]] program of spiritual and character development. AA's initial [[Twelve Traditions]] were introduced in 1946 to help the fellowship be stable and unified while disengaged from "outside issues" and influences.

The Traditions recommend that members and groups remain anonymous in public media, altruistically help other alcoholics and avoid official affiliations with other organizations. They also advise against dogma and coercive hierarchies. Subsequent fellowships such as [[Narcotics Anonymous]] have adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions to their respective primary purposes.<ref name="TRADITIONS1949">{{cite journal |journal=The AA Grapevine |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous |date=November 1949 |volume=6 |issue=6 |title=The Twelve Traditions |issn=0362-2584 |oclc=50379271}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Twelve-Step and Mutual-Help Programs for Addictive Disorders|journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America|volume=22 |issue=2 |year=1999 |doi=10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70085-X |pmid=10385942 |last1=Chappel |first1=JN |last2=Dupont |first2=RL |pages=425–46}}</ref>

According to AA's 2014 membership survey, 27% of members have been sober less than one year, 24% have 1–5 years sober, 13% have 5–10 years, 14% have 10–20 years, and 22% have more than 20 years sober.<ref name="MembershipSurvey">{{cite web |title=Alcoholics Anonymous 2014 Membership Survey |publisher=A.A.

AA's name is derived from its first book, informally called "The Big Book", originally titled ''[[The Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous)|Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered From Alcoholism]]''.

==Oxford Group origins==
{{Main article| History of Alcoholics Anonymous}}

AA sprang from [[The Oxford Group]], a non-denominational movement modeled after first-century Christianity.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cheever, Susan |title=My name is Bill: Bill Wilson: his life and the creation of Alcoholics Anonymous |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |year=2004 |page= 129|isbn=0-7432-0154-X }}</ref> Some members founded the Group to help in maintaining sobriety. "Grouper" [[Ebby Thacher]] was Wilson's former drinking buddy who approached Wilson saying that he had "got religion", was sober, and that Wilson could do the same if he set aside objections to religion and instead formed a personal idea of God, "another power" or "higher power".<ref name="Pass It On, p 117">''Pass It On'', p 117.</ref>{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=17}}

Feeling a "kinship of common suffering" and, though drunk, Wilson attended his first Group gathering.  Within days, Wilson admitted himself to the [[Charles B. Towns|Charles B. Towns Hospital]] after drinking four beers on the way—the last alcohol he ever drank. Under the care of [[William Duncan Silkworth|Dr. William Duncan Silkworth]] (an early benefactor of AA), Wilson's detox included the [[deliriant]] [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]].<ref>Pittman, Bill "AA the Way it Began"  1988, Glenn Abbey Books</ref>  At the hospital a despairing Wilson experienced a bright flash of light, which he felt to be God revealing himself.{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=19–20}} Following his hospital discharge Wilson joined the Oxford Group and recruited other alcoholics to the Group.  Wilson's early efforts to help others become sober were ineffective, prompting Dr. Silkworth to suggest that Wilson place less stress on religion and more on "the science" of treating alcoholism. Wilson's first success came during a business trip to Akron, Ohio, where he was introduced to Dr. Robert Smith, a surgeon and Oxford Group member who was unable to stay sober. After thirty days of working with Wilson, Smith drank his last drink on June 10, 1935, the date marked by AA for its anniversaries.{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=33}}

While Wilson and Smith credited their sobriety to working with alcoholics under the auspices of the Oxford Group, a Group associate pastor sermonized against Wilson and his alcoholic Groupers for forming a "secret, ashamed sub-group" engaged in "divergent works".{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=45}} By 1937, Wilson separated from the Oxford Group. AA Historian Ernest Kurtz described the split:{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=45}}
<blockquote>''...more and more, Bill discovered that new adherents could get sober by believing in each other and in the strength of this group.  Men [no women were members yet] who had proven over and over again, by extremely painful experience, that they could not get sober on their own had somehow become more powerful when two or three of them worked on their common problem. This, then—whatever it was that occurred among them—was what they could accept as a power greater than themselves. They did not need the Oxford Group.''
</blockquote>

In 1955, Wilson acknowledged AA's debt, saying "The Oxford Groupers had clearly shown us what to do. And just as importantly, we learned from them ''what not to do.''"  Among the Oxford Group practices that AA retained were informal gatherings, a "changed-life" developed through "stages", and working with others for no material gain, AA's analogs for these are meetings, "the steps", and sponsorship. AA's tradition of anonymity was a reaction to the publicity-seeking practices of the Oxford Group, as well as AA's wish to not promote, Wilson said, "erratic public characters who through broken anonymity might get drunk and destroy confidence in us."{{sfn|Kurtz|1991|p=46-47}}

==The Big Book, the Twelve Steps and the Twelve Traditions==
To share their method, Wilson and other members wrote the initially-titled book, ''Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How More Than One Hundred Men Have Recovered from Alcoholism'',<ref>[http://gsowatch.aamo.info/1939/uslaw.htm GSOwatch.aamo.info]</ref> from which AA drew its name. Informally known as "The Big Book" (with its first 164 pages virtually unchanged since the 1939 edition), it suggests a twelve-step program in which members admit that they are powerless over alcohol and need help from a "higher power". They seek guidance and strength through prayer and meditation from God or a [[Higher Power]] of their own understanding; take a moral inventory with care to include resentments; list and become ready to remove character defects; list and make amends to those harmed; continue to take a moral inventory, pray, meditate, and try to help other alcoholics recover. The second half of the book, "Personal Stories" (subject to additions, removal and retitling in subsequent editions), is made of AA members' redemptive autobiographical sketches.

In 1941, interviews on American radio and favorable articles in US magazines, including a piece by Jack Alexander in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', led to increased book sales and membership.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-12_theJackAlexArticle1.pdf |title=Alcoholics Anonymous |date=1 March 1941 |author=Jack Alexander |journal=Saturday Eventing Post |edition=Reprinted in booklet form |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous World Services |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyRPXTQK?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aa.org%2Fpdf%2Fproducts%2Fp-12_theJackAlexArticle1.pdf |isbn=0-89638-199-4 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> By 1946, as the growing fellowship quarreled over structure, purpose, and authority, as well as finances and publicity, Wilson began to form and promote what became known as AA's "Twelve Traditions," which are guidelines for an altruistic, unaffiliated, non-coercive, and non-hierarchical structure that limited AA's purpose to only helping alcoholics on a non-professional level while shunning publicity. Eventually he gained formal adoption and inclusion of the Twelve Traditions in all future editions of the Big Book.<ref name="TRADITIONS1949"/> At the 1955 conference in St. Louis, Missouri, Wilson relinquished stewardship of AA to the General Service Conference,<ref>Pass It On 1984, p. 359</ref> as AA grew to millions of members internationally.<ref name="AAFACTFILE"/>

In 2006, AA counted 1,867,212 members and 106,202 AA groups worldwide.<ref name="AAFACTFILE" /> The Twelve Traditions informally guide how individual AA groups function, and the Twelve Concepts for World Service guide how the organization is structured globally.<ref>{{cite web|title=The A.A.

A member who accepts a service position or an organizing role is a "trusted servant" with terms rotating and limited, typically lasting three months to two years and determined by group vote and the nature of the position. Each group is a self-governing entity with AA World Services acting only in an advisory capacity. AA is served entirely by alcoholics, except for seven "nonalcoholic friends of the fellowship" of the 21-member AA Board of Trustees.<ref name="AAFACTFILE"/>

AA groups are self-supporting, relying on voluntary donations from members to cover expenses.<ref name="AAFACTFILE"/> The AA General Service Office (GSO) limits contributions to US$3,000 a year.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A.A. GSO Guidelines: Finances |url=http://www.aa.org/lang/en/en_pdfs/mg-15_finance.pdf |accessdate=2009-12-12 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyQ0kRis?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aa.org%2Flang%2Fen%2Fen_pdfs%2Fmg-15_finance.pdf |publisher=Alcoholics Anonymous General Service Office |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> Above the group level, AA may hire outside professionals for services that require specialized expertise or full-time responsibilities.<ref name="TRADITIONS1949"/>

It also maintains service centers, which coordinate activities such as printing literature, responding to public inquiries, and organizing conferences. They are funded by local members and are responsible to the AA groups they represent. Other International General Service Offices (Australia, Costa Rica, Russia, etc.) are independent of AA World Services in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.org/lang/en/aa_international.cfm?origpage=31 |title=Alcoholics Anonymous : International General Service Offices |work=Alcoholics Anonymous website |accessdate=2009-10-08 |archivedate=2009-12-12 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyQO0oho?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aa.org%2Flang%2Fen%2Faa_international.cfm%3Forigpage%3D31 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>

AA's program is an inheritor of [[Counter-Enlightenment]] philosophy. AA shares the view that acceptance of one's inherent limitations is critical to finding one's proper place among other humans and God. Such ideas are described as "Counter-Enlightenment" because they are contrary to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s ideal that humans have the capacity to make their lives and societies a heaven on earth using their own power and reason.<ref name="HUMPHREYS1995"/>  
After evaluating AA's literature and observing AA meetings for sixteen months, sociologists David R. Rudy and Arthur L. Greil found that for an AA member to remain sober a high level of commitment is necessary. This commitment is facilitated by a change in the member's [[world view|worldview]]. To help members stay sober AA must, they argue, provide an all-encompassing worldview while creating and sustaining an atmosphere of transcendence in the organization. To be all-encompassing AA's ideology places an emphasis on tolerance rather than on a narrow religious worldview that could make the organization unpalatable to potential members and thereby limit its effectiveness. AA's emphasis on the spiritual nature of its program, however, is necessary to institutionalize a feeling of transcendence. A tension results from the risk that the necessity of transcendence, if taken too literally, would compromise AA's efforts to maintain a broad appeal. As this tension is an integral part of AA, Rudy and Greil argue that AA is best described as a ''quasi-religious organization''.<ref name="RUDY1989">{{cite journal |last1=Rudy |first1=David R. |last2=Greil |first2=Arthur L. |title=Is Alcoholics Anonymous a Religious Organization?: Meditations on Marginality |volume=50 |issue=1 |year=1989 |pages=41–51 |doi=10.2307/3710917 |jstor=3710917 |journal=Sociological Analysis}}</ref>

Local AA directories list a variety of weekly meetings. Those listed as "closed" are available to those with a self professed "a desire to stop drinking" that cannot be challenged by another member on any grounds.<ref name="TRADITIONS1949"/> "Open" meetings are available to anyone (nonalcoholics can attend as observers).<ref name=AAgroup>{{cite book|title=The A.A.

==Spirituality==
A study found an association between an increase in attendance to AA meetings with increased spirituality and a decrease in the frequency and intensity of alcohol use.  The research also found that AA was effective at helping agnostics and atheists become sober. The authors concluded that though spirituality was an important mechanism of behavioral change for some alcoholics, it was not the only effective mechanism.<ref>Kelly, John F.  et al. Spirituality in Recovery: A Lagged Mediational Analysis of Alcoholics Anonymous’ Principal Theoretical Mechanism of Behavior Change Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research Vol. 35, No. 3 March 2011 pp.&nbsp;1–10</ref> Since the mid-1970s, a number of 'agnostic' or 'no-prayer' AA groups have begun across the U.S., Canada, and other parts of the world, which hold meetings that adhere to a tradition allowing alcoholics to freely express their doubts or disbelief that spirituality will help their recovery, and forgo use of opening or closing prayers.<ref name="HNN2011">{{cite news |last=C. |first=Roger |publisher=Humanist Network News |date=Nov 2011 |title=A History of Agnsotic Groups in Alcoholics Anonymous: Part 1 |url=http://americanhumanist.org/HNN/details/2011-11-a-history-of-agnostic-groups-in-alcoholics-anonymous |accessdate=2014-02-12}}</ref><ref name="NYT2014">{{cite news |last=Freedman |first=Samuel |publisher=The New York Times |date=Feb 21, 2014 |title=Alcoholics Anonymous, Without the Religion |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/22/us/alcoholics-anonymous-without-the-religion.html |accessdate=2014-02-26}}</ref>  There are online resources listing AA meetings for atheists and agnostics.<ref>http://www.agnosticaanyc.org/worldwide.html for example is a directory of agnostic AA meetings</ref>

==Disease concept of alcoholism==
{{Main article|Disease theory of alcoholism}}

More informally than not, AA's membership has helped popularize the disease concept of alcoholism, though AA officially has had no part in the development of such postulates which had appeared as early as the late eighteenth century.<ref>{{cite book|first=Benjamin|last=Rush|title=Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent Spirits upon the Human Body and Mind|publisher=Bartam|location=Philadelphia|year=1805}}</ref>  Though AA initially avoided the term "disease", in 1973 conference-approved literature categorically stated that "we had the disease of alcoholism."<ref>[http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/p-3_isaaforyou.pdf AA.org]</ref>  Regardless of official positions, from AA's inception most members have believed alcoholism to be a disease.<ref name="bhrm.org">[http://www.bhrm.org/papers/AAand%20DiseaseConcept.pdf BHRM.org]</ref>

Though cautious regarding the medical nature of alcoholism, AA has let others voice opinions. The Big Book states that alcoholism "is an illness which only a spiritual experience will conquer." Ernest Kurtz says this is "The closest the book Alcoholics Anonymous comes to a definition of alcoholism."<ref name="bhrm.org"/>  In his introduction to The Big Book, non-member [[William Duncan Silkworth|Dr. William Silkworth]] said those unable to moderate their drinking have an allergy. Addressing the allergy concept, AA said "The doctor’s theory that we have an allergy to alcohol interests us. As laymen, our opinion as to its soundness may, of course, mean little.  But as ex-problem drinkers, we can say that his explanation makes good sense.  It explains many things for which we cannot otherwise account."<ref name="Alcoholics Anonymous page xxvi">''Alcoholics Anonymous'' page xxx</ref> AA later acknowledged that "alcoholism is not a true allergy, the experts now inform us."<ref>''Living Sober'' p 68</ref> Wilson explained in 1960 why AA had refrained from using the term "disease":
<blockquote>We AAs have never called alcoholism a disease because, technically speaking, it is not a disease entity. For example, there is no such thing as heart disease. Instead there are many separate heart ailments or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. Therefore, we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Hence, we have always called it an illness or a malady—a far safer term for us to use.

==Canadian and United States demographics==
AA's New York General Service Office regularly surveys AA members in North America. Its 2014 survey of over 6,000 members in Canada and the United States concluded that, in North America, AA members who responded to the survey were 62% male and 38% female.<ref name="MembershipSurvey" />

Average member sobriety is slightly under 10 years with 36% sober more than ten years, 13% sober from five to ten years, 24% sober from one to five years, and 27% sober less than one year.<ref name="MembershipSurvey" /> Before coming to AA, 63% of members received some type of treatment or counseling, such as medical, psychological, or spiritual. After coming to AA, 59% received outside treatment or counseling. Of those members, 84% said that outside help played an important part in their recovery.<ref name="MembershipSurvey" />

The same survey showed that AA received 32% of its membership from other members, another 32% from treatment facilities, 30% were self-motivated to attend AA, 12% of its membership from court–ordered attendance, and only 1% of AA members decided to join based on information obtained from the Internet.  People taking the survey were allowed to select multiple answers for what motivated them to join AA.<ref name="MembershipSurvey" />

==Effectiveness==

===Research limitations===
AA tends to polarize observers into believers and non-believers,{{sfn|Vaillant|1995|p=255}} and discussion of AA often creates controversy rather than objective reflection.{{sfn|Vaillant|1995|p=265}}  Moreover, a randomized study of AA is difficult: AA members are not randomly selected from the population of chronic alcoholics; they are instead self-selected or mandated by courts to attend AA meetings.<ref>Griffith 2002, p. 103–117</ref> There are two opposing types of self-selection bias: (1) drinkers may be motivated to stop drinking before they participate in AA; (2) AA may attract the more severe and difficult cases.<ref name="HUMPHREYS2002">{{cite journal | last = Humphreys | first = Keith | journal = Recent Developments in Alcoholism | title = Alcoholics Anonymous and 12-Step Alcoholism Treatment Programs | volume = 16 | publisher = Springer US | doi = 10.1007/b100495 | year = 2002 | pages = 149–164 | pmid = 12638636 | isbn = 978-0-306-47258-9 | series = Recent Developments in Alcoholism | editor1-last = Galanter | editor1-first = Marc | editor2-last = Begleiter | editor2-first = Henri | editor3-last = Deitrich | editor3-first = Richard | editor4-last = Gallant | editor4-first = Donald}}</ref>

A 2014 study by Keith Humphreys, Janet Blodgett and Todd Wagner concluded that "increasing AA attendance leads to short and long term decreases in alcohol consumption that cannot be attributed to self-selection."<ref name="PMC4285560"/> [[Austin Frakt]], writing for [[The New York Times]], discusses how the study's methodology minimizes outside factors, such as how motivated the people who succeed at becoming abstinent are.<ref>{{cite news | last=Frakt | first=Austin | date=2015-04-06 | title=Alcoholics Anonymous and the Challenge of Evidence-Based Medicine | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/upshot/alcoholics-anonymous-and-the-challenge-of-evidence-based-medicine.html | newspaper = The New York Times | access-date=2015-06-21}}</ref>

A study published in 2016 shows that prayer helps people who have achieved sobriety in Alcoholics Anonymous reduce cravings for alcohol.<ref>{{cite journal | authors= Marc Galanter, Zoran Josipovic, Helen Dermatis, Jochen Weber, and Mary Alice Millard | date=2016-03-25 | title=An initial fMRI study on neural correlates of prayer in members of Alcoholics Anonymous | journal = The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/00952990.2016.1141912 | laysummary = http://www.medicaldaily.com/alcoholics-anonymous-reduce-cravings-prayer-385092 | doi = 10.3109/00952990.2016.1141912 | pages=1–11}}</ref> The study used a [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] machine to scan how subjects reacted to images of people drinking. The study randomly assigned the subjects, so that some subjects saw the images after saying prayers in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous; others after reading newspaper articles. The people who had just seen the prayers reported feeling fewer cravings for alcohol; the MRI scans of their brains confirmed that there was a different reaction.

=== ''The Sober Truth'' ===

Dodes, in "The Sober Truth", argues that most people who have experienced AA have not achieved long-term sobriety, making the controversial argument that research indicates that only 5 to 8 percent of the people who go to one or more AA meetings achieve sobriety for longer than one year.<ref name="Dodes">{{cite book|title = The Sober Truth: Debunking the Bad Science Behind 12-Step Programs and the Rehab Industry|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0807033159|quote = Even though AA does not conduct scientific studies on its success rates, a number of clinicians have tried to audit the figures. The National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey, a 1992 review by the US Census Bureau and National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), included a survey of AA members. It found that only 31 percent of them were still attending after one year. AA itself has published a comparable figure in a set of comments on its own thirteen-year internal survey, stating that only 26 percent of people who attend AA stay for longer than one year.33 A third study found that after eighteen months, between 14 and 18 percent of people still attended AA. So let us assume that between 14 percent and 31 percent of people stay with AA for more than one year. Now we must ask: out of this remaining population, how many stay sober? .... These totals all fall within a close range. Together, they support the fact that roughly 5 to 8 percent of the total population of people who enter AA are able to achieve and maintain sobriety for longer than one year.|author1 = Lance Dodes, M.D.|author2 = Zachary Dodes}}</ref>  Gabrielle Glaser used Dodes' figures to argue that AA has a low success rate in a 2015 article for The Atlantic.<ref>{{Cite web

The 5 to 8 percent figure put forward by Dodes is controversial; Thomas Beresford, MD., writing for the [[National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence]], says that the book uses "three separate, questionable, calculations that arrive at the 5-8% figure."<ref name="Beresford">{{Citation |last=Beresford |first=Thomas |year=2016 |title=Alcoholics Anonymous and The Atlantic: A Call For Better Science |publisher=National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence |url=https://www.ncadd.org/blogs/research-update/alcoholics-anonymous-call-for-better-science |accessdate=2016-04-15 }}</ref> This is not the only criticism the book has received; The New York Times calls ''The Sober Truth'' a "[[polemic]]al and deeply flawed book" <ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/health/the-sober-truth-seeing-bad-science-in-rehab.html?_r=3</ref> and John F. Kelly, an associate professor at Harvard, as well as Gene Beresin, a professor at Harvard, feel that the book's conclusion that "[12-step] approaches are almost completely ineffective and even harmful in treating substance use disorders" is wrong (Dodes responded by pointing out that "I have never said that AA is harmful in general"), noting that "studies published in prestigious peer-reviewed scientific journals have found that 12-step treatments that facilitate engagement with AA post-discharge [...] produce about one third higher continuous abstinence rates" <ref>[http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/04/defense-12-step-addiction In Defense Of 12 Steps: What Science Really Tells Us About Addiction | CommonHealth<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=HUMPHREYS2001/>

===Health-care costs===
As a volunteer-supported program, AA is free of charge. This contrasts with treatments for alcoholism such as inpatient treatment, drug therapy, psychotherapy, and cognitive-based therapy. One study found that the institutional use of twelve-step-facilitation therapy to encourage participation in AA reduced healthcare expenditures by 45% when compared to another group that was not encouraged to participate in AA.<ref name="HUMPHREYS2001">{{cite journal | last = Humphreys | first = Keith |date=May 2001 | title = Can encouraging substance abuse patients to participate in self-help groups reduce demand for health care?

==Relationship with institutions==

===Hospitals===
Many AA meetings take place in treatment facilities. Carrying the message of AA into hospitals was how the co-founders of AA first remained sober.

United States courts have ruled that inmates, parolees, and probationers cannot be ordered to attend AA. Though AA itself was not deemed a religion, it was ruled that it contained ''enough'' religious components (variously described in ''Griffin v.

A cross-sectional survey of substance-misuse treatment providers in the West Midlands found fewer than 10% integrated twelve-step methods in their practice and only a third felt their consumers were suited for Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous membership. Less than half were likely to recommend self-help groups to their clients. Providers with nursing qualifications were more likely to make such referrals than those without them. A statistically significant correlation was found between providers' self-reported level of spirituality and their likelihood of recommending AA or NA.<ref name="DAY2005">{{cite journal |date=December 2005 |title=United Kingdom substance misuse treatment workers' attitudes toward 12-step self-help groups |journal=Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment |volume=29 |issue=4  |pages=321–327 |doi=10.1016/j.jsat.2005.08.009 |pmid=16311185 |last1=Day |first1=E |last2=Gaston |first2=RL |last3=Furlong |first3=E |last4=Murali |first4=V |last5=Copello |first5=A}}</ref>

==Criticism==
{{See also|Twelve-step program}}

===Thirteenth Stepping===
<!-- "Thirteenth Stepping" redirects to this section -->
"Thirteenth-stepping" is a pejorative term for AA members approaching new members for dates or sex. The ''Journal of Addiction Nursing'' reported that 50% of the women that participated in a survey (55 in all) experienced 13-stepping behavior from others.<ref name="BOGART2003">{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Addictions Nursing: A Journal for the Prevention and Management of Addictions |title='13th-Stepping:' Why Alcoholics Anonymous Is Not Always a Safe Place for Women |last=Bogart |first=Cathy J. |year=2003 |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=43–47 |doi=10.1080/10884600305373 |issn=1548-7148 |oclc=34618968 |last2=Bogart |first2=Cathy J.}}</ref> AA's pamphlet on sponsorship suggests that men be sponsored by men and women be sponsored by women.<ref>Questions and Answers on Sponsorship, page 10. 2005.</ref>

===Moderation or abstinence===
{{see also|Alcoholism#Management|l1=Alcoholism: Management}}

[[Stanton Peele]] argued that some AA groups apply the [[Disease model of addiction|disease model]] to all problem drinkers, whether or not they are "full-blown" alcoholics.<ref>Peele 1989</ref> Along with Nancy Shute, Peele has advocated that besides AA, other options should be readily available to those problem drinkers who are able to manage their drinking with the right treatment.<ref name="SHUTE1997">{{cite journal | last = Shute | first = Nancy | title = The drinking dilemma: by calling abstinence the only cure, we ensure that the nation's $100 billion alcohol problem won't be solved | journal = [[U.S. News & World Report]] | volume = 123 | issue = 9 |date=September 1997 | pages = 54–64 |url=http://silkworth.net/magazine_newspaper/us_news_world_report_sep_8_1997.html}}</ref> The Big Book says "moderate drinkers" and "a certain type of hard drinker" are able to stop or moderate their drinking. The Big Book suggests no program for these drinkers, but instead seeks to help drinkers without "power of choice in drink."<ref>''Alcoholics Anonymous'' page 20-1,24</ref>

===Cultural identity===
One review of AA warned of detrimental [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] effects of twelve-step philosophy and concluded that AA uses many methods that are also used by cults.<ref name="ALEXANDER1984">{{cite journal|last1=Alexander |first1=Francesa |first2=Michele |last2=Rollins |year=1985 |title=Alcoholics Anonymous: the unseen cult |journal=California Sociologist |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=33–48 |issn=0162-8712 |oclc=4025459 |location=Los Angeles |publisher=[[California State University]] |url=http://www.silkworth.net/sociology/Soc63OCR.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lyBcw4EM?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.silkworth.net%2Fsociology%2FSoc63OCR.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-12 |accessdate=2009-12-12 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>  A subsequent study concluded, however, that AA's program bore little resemblance to religious cults because the techniques used appeared beneficial.<ref name="WRIGHT1997">{{cite journal |title=Shared Ideology in Alcoholics Anonymous: A Grounded Theory Approach |doi=10.1080/108107397127806 |year=1997 |last1=Right |first1=Kevin B. W |journal=Journal of Health Communication |volume=2 |pmid=10977242 |issue=2 |pages=83–99}}</ref> Another study found that the AA program's focus on admission of having a problem increases deviant [[Stigma (sociological theory)|stigma]] and strips members of their previous [[cultural identity]], replacing it with the deviant identity.<ref name="LEVINSON1983">{{cite journal | last = Levinson | first = D. | year = 1983 | journal = Recent Developments in Alcoholism | title = Current status of the field: An anthropological perspective on the behavior modification treatment of alcoholism | pages = 255–261 | location = New York | publisher = Plenum Press | volume = 1 | editor = Galanter, Marc | issn = 0738-422X | pmid = 6680227 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-3617-4_14}}</ref> A survey of group members, however, found they had a [[Biculturalism|bicultural]] identity and saw AA's program as a complement to their other national, ethnic, and religious cultures.{{sfn|Wilcox|1998|p=109–124}}

===Other criticisms===
*In 1964, Arthur H. Cain – by his own count – had attended over 500 AA meetings since 1947.  Cain insisted that "I do not suggest for a moment that a single A.A. quit the fellowship. On the contrary, I strongly urge sticking with it. To anyone who is having trouble with alcohol I say: try A.A. first; it's the answer for most people". Even so, Cain thought that AA had become the domain of irreligious misfits "Dogmatic and opinionated in their nonbeliefs", who scorned other societies such as [[Kiwanis|the Kiwanis Club]]. Cain said AA had come to rely heavily on dogmatic slogans and the group. Without referencing or fashioning a definition of the term, Cain called AA a "cult" and "a hindrance to research, psychiatry, and to many alcoholics who need a different kind of help".<ref name="CAIN1963">[http://harpers.org/archive/1963/02/0014211 Harpers.org]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://harpers.org/archive/1963/02/alcoholics-anonymous/ |title=Alcoholics Anonymous &#124; Harper's Magazine |first=Arthur H. |last=Cainwork=harpers.org |year=2014 |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}</ref>
