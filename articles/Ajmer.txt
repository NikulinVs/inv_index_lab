'''Ajmer''' ({{IPA-hns|ədʒmeːr|pron|Ajmer.ogg}}) is one of the major cities in the Indian state of [[Rajasthan]] and is the centre of the eponymous [[Ajmer District]]. According to the 2011 census, Ajmer has a population of around 551,360 in its urban agglomeration and 542,580 in the city. The city is located at a distance of 135&nbsp;km from the state capital [[Jaipur]] and 391&nbsp;km from the national capital [[New Delhi]].

The city was established by a [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Shakambhari Chahamana]] (Chauhan) ruler, either [[Ajayaraja I]] or [[Ajayaraja II]], and served as the Chahamana capital until the 12th century CE. After the defeat of Prithviraja lll in 1192 CE, the city came under Muslim rule.

Ajmer is surrounded by the [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli Mountains]]. It is a pilgrimage centre for the shrine of the [[Sufi]] Saint [[Khwaja]] [[Moinuddin Chishti]] and is also the base for visiting [[Pushkar]] (11&nbsp;km), an ancient Hindu pilgrimage city, famous for the temple of [[Brahma]]. Ajmer has been selected as one of the heritage cities for the [[HRIDAY - Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana]] scheme of Government of India.<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://hridayindia.in/|website=Hriday official website}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main article|History of Ajmer}}
[[File:Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Jahangir receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on his return from the Mewar campaign]]

Ajmer was originally known as ''Ajayameru''. The 12th century text ''[[Prithviraja Vijaya]]'' states that the [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Shakambhari Chahamana]] (Chauhan) king [[Ajayaraja II]] (ruled {{circa|1110}}{{snd}}1135 CE) established the city of Ajayameru.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=87}} Historian [[Dasharatha Sharma]] notes that the earliest mention of the city's name occurs in Palha's ''[[Pattavali]]'', which was copied in 1113 CE (1170 [[Vikrama Samvat|VS]]) at [[Dhara (city)|Dhara]]. This suggests that Ajmer was founded sometime before 1113 CE.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=40}} A ''[[prashasti]]'' (eulogistic inscription), issued by [[Vigraharaja IV]] and found at [[Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra]], states Ajayadeva (that is, Ajayaraja II) moved his residence to Ajmer.{{sfn|Har Bilas Sarda|1911|pp=68-74}}

The later text ''[[Prabandha Kosha|Prabandha-Kosha]]'' states that it was the 8th century king [[Ajayaraja I]] who commissioned the Ajayameru fort, which later came to be known as the Taragarh fort of Ajmer.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=87}} According to historian R. B. Singh, this claim appears to be true, as inscriptions dated to the 8th century CE have been found at Ajmer.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=88}} Singh theorizes that Ajayaraja II later enlarged the town, constructed palaces, and moved the Chahamana capital from [[Sambhar, Rajasthan|Shakambhari]] to Ajmer.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=131-132}}

Ajmer has a hot, semi-arid climate with over 55 centimetres (25.4&nbsp;in) of rain every year, but most of the rain occurs in the [[monsoon]] months, between June and September. Temperatures remain relatively high throughout the year, with the summer months of April to early July having an average daily temperature of about 30&nbsp;°C (86&nbsp;°F). During the monsoon there is frequent heavy rain and thunderstorms, but flooding is not a common occurrence. The winter months of November to February are mild and temperate with average temperatures ranging from 15–18&nbsp;°C (59–64&nbsp;°F) with little or no humidity. There are, however, occasional cold weather fronts that cause temperatures to fall to near freezing levels.

[[File:Parshvnath bhagwan.jpeg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Parshvanatha]] at a Jain temple in Ajmer]]
*'''The [[Ajmer Sharif Dargah]]''': It is a shrine of Khwaja [[Moinuddin Chishti]] which is situated at the foot of the Taragarh hill, and consists of several white marble buildings arranged around two courtyards, including a massive gate donated by the [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad state|Hyderabad]], and the Akbari Mosque, built by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]] and containing the domed tomb of the saint. [[Akbar]] and his queen used to come here by foot every year on pilgrimage from [[Agra]] in observance of a vow when he prayed for a son. The large pillars called "Kose ('Mile') Minars", erected at intervals of two miles (3&nbsp;km) along the entire way between Agra and Ajmer mark the places where the royal pilgrims halted every day.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Ajmere|volume=1|pages=452-453}}</ref> It has been estimated that around 125,000 pilgrims visit the site every day.
*'''Happy valley''' (Chashma a Noor)
*'''Dargah Of Miran Syed Husain''': At the highest point of Taragarh fort stands the Dargah of Hazrat Miran Syed Husian Asghar Khangswar who was the governor of Ajmer after its conquest by Sultan Shahabuddin Ghori. On the death of Qutubuddin Aibak in 1210 C.E., the Rathor and Chauhan Rajputs joined in a night attack on the Taragarh Fort when most of the men of Miran Saheb were out collecting taxes in the district, and the number of his garrison was numerically very small. The Rajpurs massacred Miran Saheb and his garrison to a man on 18th Rajab.
*'''Taragarh Fort''': The fort guarding Ajmer, was the seat of the [[Chauhan]] rulers and was originally believed to be built by [[Mughals|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar]].<ref name=Madan/> It is reputed to be one of the oldest hill forts in India and the world. It was built by King Ajaypal Chauhan on the summit of Taragarh Hill and overlooks Ajmer. The battlements run along the top of the hill. The walls are two miles (3&nbsp;km) in circumference and the fort can only be approached by way of a very steep slope. When it fell to the [[British Raj]], the fort was dismantled on the orders of [[Lord William Bentinck]] and was converted into a sanatorium for the British troops stationed at the garrison town of [[Nasirabad, India|Nasirabad]].<ref name="EB1911"/>
*'''[[Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra|Adhai Din Ka Jhonpda]]''': A mosque by [[Qutubuddin Aibak]] built in 1193, is situated on the lower slope of Taragarh hill. Aibak's successor, Shams al-Din [[Iltutmish]] added to the mosque. It is noted for its double-depth calligraphy inscriptions in the [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] and [[Kufic]] scripts. Apart from the mosque, called Jama [[Iltutmish]] (pronounced ''Altamash'' locally), nearly the whole of the ancient temple has fallen into ruins, but the relics are still unsurpassed as examples of Hindu architecture and sculpture. Forty columns support the roof, but no two are alike and the ornaments are exceptional in their decorations.<ref>[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=7605 Arhai-din-ka Jhompra Mosque] archnet.org.</ref><ref name="EB1911"/>
*'''[[Akbari Fort & Museum]]''' : The city's museum, was once the residence of Prince [[Jahangir|Salīm]], the son of the Emperor [[Akbar]], and presently houses a collection of Mughal and [[Rajput]] armour and sculpture. This is a magnificent example of Mughal architecture, construction of which was commissioned by Akbar in 1570. This is where Salim, as the Emperor [[Jahangir]], read out the [[firman]] permitting the [[British East India Company]] to trade with India.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rajasthangk.net/2013/05/akbar-ka-kila-ajmer-akbars-fort.html|title=Akbar Ka Kila , AJMER|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>

*'''[[Mayo College]]''': The college was founded in 1875 by [[Richard Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo|Lord Mayo]], [[Viceroy of India]]. The architecture of the buildings is in the same style as royal [[Architecture of Rajasthan|Rajasthani architecture]]. The main building, in white marble, is a classic example of [[Indo-Saracenic]] architecture.<ref>[http://www.mayocollege.com/AboutBuildingArch.asp Main Building Architecture: Official website of Mayo College, Ajmer, India]</ref>
