==Education and early life==
Wiles was born in 1953 in [[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]], England, the son of [[Maurice Wiles|Maurice Frank Wiles]] (1923–2005), the [[Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford]],<ref name="whoswho"/> and Patricia Wiles (née Mowll). His father worked as the Chaplain at [[Ridley Hall, Cambridge]], for the years 1952–55. Wiles attended King's College School, Cambridge, and [[The Leys School, Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Cambridge-born mathematician awarded top prize for solving centuries-old numerical problem|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/cambridge-born-mathematician-awarded-prize/story-28927992-detail/story.html|accessdate=16 March 2016|publisher=[[Cambridge News]]}}{{dead link|date=March 2016}}</ref>

Wiles states that he came across Fermat's Last Theorem on his way home from school when he was 10 years old. He stopped by his local library where he found a book about the theorem.<ref name=pbs/> Fascinated by the existence of a theorem that was so easy to state that he, a ten-year-old, could understand it, but nobody had proven it, he decided to be the first person to prove it. However, he soon realised that his knowledge was too limited, so he abandoned his childhood dream, until it was brought back to his attention at the age of 33 by [[Ken Ribet]]'s 1986 proof of the [[epsilon conjecture]], which [[Gerhard Frey]] had previously linked to Fermat's famous equation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chang|first1=Sooyoung|title=Academic Genealogy of Mathematicians|date=2011|isbn=9789814282291|page=207|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=4siw31DPONUC&pg=PA207&lpg=PA207&source=bl&ots=b21Fsg7_UP&sig=xHkiD5-RBY3pGzj-0vTh-IYcaz8&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj7xdG_6cTLAhVIAZoKHZA7DHQQ6AEIQjAE#v=onepage}}</ref>

==Career and research==
Wiles earned his [[bachelor's degree]] in mathematics in 1974 at [[Merton College, Oxford]], and a PhD in 1980 at [[Clare College, Cambridge]]. After a stay at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[New Jersey]] in 1981, Wiles became a professor at [[Princeton University]]. In 1985–86, Wiles was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] near Paris and at the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. From 1988 to 1990, Wiles was a [[Royal Society]] Research Professor at the [[University of Oxford]], and then he returned to Princeton. He rejoined Oxford in 2011 as Royal Society Research Professor.<ref name=andrew>{{cite web|first1=John J.|last1=O'Connor|first2=Edmund F.|last2=Robertson|title=Wiles Biography|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Wiles.html|publisher=[[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]]|date=September 2009|accessdate=16 March 2016}}</ref>

Wiles's graduate research was guided by [[John Coates (mathematician)|John Coates]] beginning in the summer of 1975. Together these colleagues worked on the arithmetic of [[elliptic curve]]s with [[complex multiplication]] by the methods of [[Iwasawa theory]]. He further worked with [[Barry Mazur]] on the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory over the [[rational number]]s, and soon afterward, he generalised this result to [[totally real field]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andrew Wiles|url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/3001745.html|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|accessdate=16 March 2016}}</ref>

===Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem===
{{main|Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem}}
Starting in mid-1986, based on successive progress of the previous few years of [[Gerhard Frey]], [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Ken Ribet]], it became clear that [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] could be proven as a corollary of a limited form of the [[modularity theorem]] (unproven at the time and then known as the "Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture"). The modularity theorem involved elliptic curves, which was also Wiles's own specialist area.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Peter|title=How Math’s Most Famous Proof Nearly Broke|url=http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-maths-most-famous-proof-nearly-broke|publisher=''Nautilus''|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=28 May 2015}}</ref>

The conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as important, but extraordinarily difficult or perhaps impossible to prove.<ref name="Singh">[[Simon Singh]] (1997). ''Fermat's Last Theorem''. ISBN 1-85702-521-0</ref>{{rp|203–205, 223, 226}} For example, Wiles's ex-supervisor [[John H. Coates|John Coates]] states that it seemed "impossible to actually prove",<ref name="Singh" />{{rp|226}} and Ken Ribet considered himself "one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible", adding that "Andrew Wiles was probably one of the few people on earth who had the audacity to dream that you can actually go and prove [it]."<ref name="Singh"/>{{rp|223}}

Despite this, Wiles, with his from-childhood fascination with Fermat's Last Theorem, decided to undertake the challenge of proving the conjecture, at least to the extent needed for Frey's curve.<ref name="Singh" />{{rp|226}} He dedicated all of his research time to this problem for over six years in near-total secrecy, covering up his efforts by releasing prior work in small segments as separate papers and confiding only in his wife.<ref name="Singh" />{{rp|229–230}}

In June 1993, he presented his proof to the public for the first time at a conference in Cambridge.
{{quote|He gave a lecture a day on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday with the title 'Modular Forms, Elliptic Curves and Galois Representations.' There was no hint in the title that Fermat's last theorem would be discussed, Dr. Ribet said. ... Finally, at the end of his third lecture, Dr. Wiles concluded that he had proved a general case of the Taniyama conjecture. Then, seemingly as an afterthought, he noted that that meant that Fermat's last theorem was true. Q.E.D.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|last=Kolata|first=Gina|title=At Last, Shout of 'Eureka!' In Age-Old Math Mystery|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/24/us/at-last-shout-of-eureka-in-age-old-math-mystery.html|accessdate=21 January 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=24 June 1993}}</ref>}}

In August 1993, it was discovered that the proof contained a flaw in one area. Wiles tried and failed for over a year to repair his proof. According to Wiles, the crucial idea for circumventing, rather than closing this area, came to him on 19 September 1994, when he was on the verge of giving up. Together with his former student [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]], he published a second paper which circumvented the problem and thus completed the proof. Both papers were published in May 1995 in a dedicated volume of the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Are mathematicians finally satisfied with Andrew Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem?

==Recognition==
Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem has stood up to the scrutiny of the world's other mathematical experts. Wiles was interviewed for an episode of the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]''<ref name="horizon">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074rxx |title=BBC TWO, Horizon Fermat's Last Theorem |publisher=BBC |date=16 December 2010 |accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref> that focused on Fermat's Last Theorem. This was renamed "The Proof", and it was made an episode of the US [[Public Broadcasting Service]]'s science television series ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]''.<ref name=pbs>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/andrew-wiles-fermat.html|title=Andrew Wiles on Solving Fermat|publisher=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]]|accessdate=16 March 2016}}</ref> His work and life are also described in great detail in [[Simon Singh]]'s popular book ''[[Fermat's Last Theorem (book)|Fermat's Last Theorem]]''.

Wiles's certificate  of election to the [[Royal Society]] reads:
{{Block quote|Andrew Wiles is almost unique amongst number-theorists in his ability to bring to bear new tools and new ideas on some of the most intractable problems of number theory. His finest achievement to date has been his proof, in joint work with Mazur, of the "main conjecture" of Iwasawa theory for cyclotomic extensions of the rational field. This work settles many of the basic problems on [[cyclotomic field]]s which go back to Kummer, and is unquestionably one of the major advances in number theory in our times. Earlier he did deep work on the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer for elliptic curves with complex multiplication – one offshoot of this was his proof of an unexpected and beautiful generalisation of the classical explicit reciprocity laws of Artin–Hasse–Iwasawa. Most recently, he has made new progress on the construction of l-adic representations attached to Hilbert modular forms, and has applied these to prove the "main conjecture" for cyclotomic extensions of totally real fields – again a remarkable result since none of the classical tools of cyclotomic fields applied to these problems.<ref name="royal">{{cite web |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1989%2F39%27) |title = EC/1989/39: Wiles, Sir Andrew John |publisher=[[The Royal Society]]|accessdate=16 March 2016}}</ref>}}
