'''AOL Inc.''' (simply known as '''AOL''', originally known as '''America Online''') is an American [[Multinational Corporation|multinational]] [[mass media]] corporation based in [[New York City|New York]], a [[subsidiary]] of [[Verizon Communications]]. The company owns and operates [[website]]s such as ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', [[TechCrunch]] and [[Engadget]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Lunden|first=Ingrid|title=AOL Reorganizes Into Membership, Brand And Ad Units [Incl Armstrong's Memo]|url=http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/29/aol-reorganizes-into-membership-brand-and-ad-units-incl-armstrongs-memo/|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref> and spans [[digital distribution]] of content, products, and services, which it offers to consumers, publishers, and advertisers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2015/06/24/verizon-gains-aol/|title=The real reason Verizon bought AOL|date=24 June 2015|publisher=}}</ref>

AOL was one of the early pioneers of the [[Internet]] in the mid-1990s, and the most recognized brand on the web in the U.S. It originally [[Internet service provider|provided a dial-up service]] to millions of Americans, as well as providing a [[web portal]], [[e-mail]], [[instant messaging]] and later a [[web browser]] following its purchase of [[Netscape]]. At the height of its popularity, it purchased the media conglomerate [[Time Warner]] in the largest merger in U.S. history. AOL rapidly declined thereafter, partly due to the decline of dial-up to [[broadband]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-verizon-buys-faded-internet-pioneer-aol-for-4.4-bn-2015-5?IR=T|title=Verizon buys faded Internet pioneer AOL for $4.4 bn|publisher=}}</ref> AOL was eventually [[Spin-off (corporate)|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2009, with [[Tim Armstrong (executive)|Tim Armstrong]] appointed the new CEO. Under his leadership, the company invested in media brands and advertising technologies.

On June 23, 2015, AOL was acquired by [[Verizon Communications]] for $4.4 billion, which turned it into a subsidiary.<ref name="buyout-cnbc">{{cite news|last1=Imbert|first1=Fred|title=Verizon to buy AOL for $4.4B; AOL shares soar|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/102670331|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=May 12, 2015|date=May 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sawers |first=Paul |url=http://venturebeat.com/2015/06/23/verizon-completes-4-4b-acquisition-of-aol/ |title=Verizon completes $4.4B acquisition of AOL |publisher=VentureBeat |date=June 23, 2015 |accessdate=June 23, 2015}}</ref> In the following months, AOL also made a deal with [[Microsoft]] and acquired several tech properties, including [[Millennial Media]] and Kanvas to bolster their mobile ad-tech capabilities.

==History==

===1983–91: Early years===
AOL began in 1983, as a short-lived venture called '''Control Video Corporation''' (or '''CVC'''), founded by [[Bill von Meister]]. Its sole product was an online service called [[GameLine]] for the [[Atari 2600]] [[video game console]], after von Meister's idea of buying music on demand was rejected by [[Warner Bros.]]<ref name="Klein2003">{{cite book |last=Klein |first=Alec |title=Stealing Time: Davin, Quinton, and the Collapse of AOL Time Warner |year=2003 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-7432-5984-X }}</ref> Subscribers bought a [[modem]] from the company for [[United States dollar|US$]]49.95 and paid a one-time US$15 setup fee. [[GameLine]] permitted subscribers to temporarily download games and keep track of high scores, at a cost of US$1 per game.<ref name=history>{{cite news|title=A Brief History of AOL|author=David Lumb|work=Fast Company|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3046194/fast-feed/a-brief-history-of-aol|date=May 12, 2015|accessdate=May 12, 2015}}</ref> The telephone disconnected and the downloaded game would remain in GameLine's Master Module and playable until the user turned off the console or downloaded another game.

In January 1983, [[Steve Case]] was hired as a marketing consultant for Control Video on the recommendation of his brother, investment banker Dan Case. In May 1983, [[Jim Kimsey]] became a manufacturing consultant for Control Video, which was near bankruptcy. Kimsey was brought in by his West Point friend [[Frank Caufield]], an investor in the company.<ref name="Klein2003" /> In early 1985, von Meister left the company.<ref name=Warner>{{cite book|title=Media Selling: Television, Print, Internet, Radio|author=Charles Warner|year=2011|isbn=1-4443-5927-4|publisher=John Wiley & Sons}}</ref>

On May 24, 1985, '''Quantum Computer Services''', an online services company, was founded by Jim Kimsey from the remnants of Control Video, with Kimsey as [[Chief Executive Officer]], and [[Marc Seriff]] as [[Chief Technology Officer]]. The technical team consisted of [[Marc Seriff]], Tom Ralston, Ray Heinrich, Steve Trus, Ken Huntsman, Janet Hunter, Dave Brown, Craig Dykstra, Doug Coward, and Mike Ficco. In 1987, Case was promoted again to executive vice-president. Kimsey soon began to groom Case to take over the role of CEO, which he did when Kimsey retired in 1991.<ref name=Warner />

Kimsey changed the company's strategy, and in 1985, launched a dedicated online service for [[Commodore 64]] and [[Commodore 128|128]] computers, originally called [[Quantum Link]] ("Q-Link" for short).<ref name=history /> The Quantum Link software was based on software licensed from [[PlayNET|PlayNet, Inc]], (founded in 1983 by Howard Goldberg and Dave Panzl). The service was different from other online services as it used the computing power of the Commodore 64 and the [[Apple II]] rather than just a "dumb" terminal. It passed tokens back and forth and provided a fixed price service tailored for home users. In May 1988, Quantum and [[Apple Computer|Apple]] launched [[AppleLink]] Personal Edition for [[Apple II family|Apple II]]<ref>{{Triangulation|201|Peter Friedman}}</ref> and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers. In August 1988, Quantum launched PC Link, a service for [[IBM]]-compatible [[personal computer|PCs]] developed in a joint venture with the [[Tandy Corporation]]. After the company parted ways with Apple in October 1989, Quantum changed the service's name to America Online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1989.htm |title=History of Computing Industrial Era (1985–1990) |work=The History of Computing Project |accessdate=September 24, 2005 |date=March 20, 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051103111647/http://www.thocp.net/timeline/1989.htm| archivedate= 3 November 2005 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah22.html |title=Apple II history chapter 22 |date=December 31, 2002 |accessdate=September 24, 2005 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050828233812/http://apple2history.org/history/ah22.html| archivedate= 28 August 2005 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  Case was promoted to and sold AOL as the online service for people unfamiliar with computers, in contrast to [[CompuServe]], which was well established in the technical community.<ref name=Warner />

From the beginning, AOL included [[online game]]s in its mix of products; many classic and casual games were included in the original PlayNet software system. In the early years of AOL the company introduced many innovative online interactive titles and games, including:
* Graphical chat environments [[Habitat (video game)|Habitat]] (1986–1988) and [[Club Caribe]] (1988) from [[LucasArts]].
* The first online interactive fiction series [[QuantumLink Serial]] by [[Tracy Reed (writer)|Tracy Reed]] (1988).
* [[Quantum Space]], the first fully automated [[Play-by-mail game|Play by email]] game (1989–1991).

[[File:America Online logo.svg|200px|thumb|left|First AOL logo as "America Online", used from 1991 to 2005.]]
In February 1991, AOL for [[DOS]] was launched using a [[GeoWorks]] interface followed a year later by AOL for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref name=history /> This coincided with growth in pay-based online services, like [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], [[CompuServe]], and [[GEnie]]. 1991 also saw the introduction of an original [[Dungeons & Dragons]] title called ''[[Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)|Neverwinter Nights]]'' from [[Stormfront Studios]]; which was one of the first Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games to depict the adventure with graphics instead of text.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bladekeep.com/nwn/index2.htm|title=The Original Neverwinter Nights 1991–1997|work=bladekeep.com}}</ref>

During the early 1990s, the average subscription lasted for about 25 months and accounted for $350 in total revenue.<ref name="quora20101224">{{cite web|url=http://www.quora.com/AOL-History/How-much-did-it-cost-AOL-to-distribute-all-those-CDs-back-in-the-1990s |title=AOL History: How much did it cost AOL to distribute all those CDs back in the 1990's? |publisher=Quora |date=2010-12-24 |accessdate=July 13, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> AOL discontinued [[Quantum Link|Q-Link]] and PC Link in late 1994.

Retrieved on July 8, 2011.</ref> This is commonly referred to as the "[[Eternal September]]", as USENET's cycle of new users was previously dominated by smaller numbers of college and university freshmen gaining access in September and taking a few weeks to acclimate. AOL quickly surpassed [[GEnie]], and by the mid-1990s, it passed [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]] (which for several years allowed AOL advertising) and [[CompuServe]].<ref name=Warner /> By 1993, AOL was able to provide [[Internet|public Internet]] access for its [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] client users.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3857628/aol-1985-history/|publisher=Time|date=May 22, 2015|title=A Brief Guide to the Tumultuous 30-Year History of AOL|author=Lily Rothman}}</ref>

Over the next several years, AOL launched services with the [[National Education Association]], the [[American Federation of Teachers]], ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[Library of Congress]], [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]], [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], [[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development|ASCD]], [[National School Boards Association|NSBA]], NCTE, [[Discovery Communications|Discovery Networks]], [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner]] Education Services ([[CNN Newsroom]]), [[NPR]], [[The Princeton Review]], [[Stanley Kaplan]], [[Barron's Educational Series|Barron's]], [[Highlights for Kids]], the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]], and many other education providers. AOL offered the first real-time homework help service (the Teacher Pager—1990; prior to this, AOL provided homework help bulletin boards), the first service by children, for children (Kids Only Online, 1991), the first online service for parents (the Parents Information Network, 1991), the first online courses (1988), the first omnibus service for teachers (the Teachers' Information Network, 1990), the first online exhibit ([[Library of Congress]], 1991), the first parental controls, and many other online education firsts.<ref>{{cite book|title=Netstudy|author=Michael Wolff|publisher=Dell Publishing|year=1997}}</ref>

AOL charged its users an hourly fee until December 1996,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1997/04/b351154.htm|title=For $19.95 a month, unlimited headaches for AOL|date=January 27, 1997}}</ref> when the company changed to a flat monthly rate of $19.95.<ref name=history /> During this time, AOL connections would be flooded with users trying to get on, and many canceled their accounts due to constant [[busy signal]]s. A commercial featuring Steve Case telling people AOL was working day and night to fix the problem was made. Within three years, AOL's user base grew to 10 million people.

AOL was quickly running out of room in October 1996 for its network at the Fairfax County campus. In 1996, AOL moved to 22000 AOL Way in [[Dulles, Virginia|Dulles]], unincorporated [[Loudoun County, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corp.aol.com/about-aol/company-overview |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208121604/http://corp.aol.com/about-aol/company-overview |archivedate=8 February 2008 |title=Company Overview |work=corp.aol.com |publisher=''AOL'' |date=February 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> The move to Dulles took place in mid-1996 and provided room for future growth. In a five-year landmark agreement with the most popular operating system, AOL was bundled with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] software.<ref>{{cite book|title=Breaking Windows: How Bill Gates Fumbled the Future of Microsoft|publisher=Simon and Schuster|author=David Bank|year=2001|isbn=978-0-7432-0315-9|page=105}}</ref>

On March 31, 1997, the short-lived [[eWorld]] was purchased by AOL. In 1997, about half of all U.S. homes with internet access had it through AOL.<ref>"The Fall of Facebook". (December 2014).  ''The Atlantic'', pp. 35.</ref> During this time, AOL's content channels, under [[Jason Seiken]], including News, Sports, and Entertainment, experienced their greatest growth as AOL become the dominant online service internationally with more than 34 million subscribers. In November 1998, AOL announced it would acquire [[Netscape]].<ref name=history /> The deal closed on March 17, 1999.

In January 2000, AOL and [[Time Warner]] announced plans to merge, forming AOL Time Warner, Inc. The terms of the deal called for AOL shareholders to own 55% of the new, combined company. The deal closed on January 11, 2001. The new company was led by executives from AOL, SBI, and Time Warner. [[Gerald Levin]], who had served as CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company.

In 2004, along with the launch of AOL 9.0 Optimized, AOL also made available the option of personalized greetings which would enable the user to hear his or her name while accessing basic functions and mail alerts, or while logging in or out. In 2005, AOL broadcast the [[Live 8]] concert live over the Internet, and thousands of users downloaded clips of the concert over the following months.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Live 8|work=Billboard|date=Jul 29, 2006|page=22}}</ref>  In late 2005, AOL released AOL Safety & Security Center, a bundle of [[McAfee Antivirus]], [[Computer Associates|CA]] anti-spyware, and proprietary [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] and [[Anti-phishing software|phishing protection]] software.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Protect your PC|work=Kiplinger's Personal Finance|date=July 2007|author=Jeff Bertolucci}}</ref>  News reports in late 2005 identified companies such as [[Yahoo!]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Google]] as candidates for turning AOL into a joint venture.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2005/tc20051111_725373.htm|title = Has AOL Met Its Match?|first = Catherine|last = Yang|work=BusinessWeek|date= November 11, 2005|accessdate =August 1, 2006 }}</ref> Those plans were abandoned when it was revealed on December 20, 2005 that Google would purchase a 5% share of AOL for $1&nbsp;billion.

'''AOL Desktop''' is an internet suite produced by AOL that integrates a [[web browser]], a [[Media player (application software)|media player]] and an [[instant messenger]] client.<ref name="daol.aol.com" /> Version 10.X was based on [[AOL OpenRide]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beta.aol.com/projects/chat/chat_logs/20070808_Helix_FormalChat.html|title=August 8th Helix Beta Chat|work=aol.com}}</ref> it is an upgrade from such.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://betanews.com/2007/07/26/aol-heads-in-new-direction-with-helix/|title=AOL Heads in New Direction with 'Helix'|work=BetaNews}}</ref> The [[macOS]] version is based on [[WebKit]].

AOL Desktop version 10.X was different from previous [[AOL Explorer|AOL browsers]] and AOL Desktop versions. Its features are focused on web browsing as well as [[email]]. For instance, one does not have to sign into AOL in order to use it as a regular browser.  In addition, non-AOL email accounts can be accessed through it. There are several predominate buttons: "MAIL", "IM", and several shortcuts to various Web Pages. The first two require users to sign in but the shortcuts to web pages can be used without authentication. AOL Desktop version 10.X was late marked as unsupported in favor of supporting the AOL Desktop 9.X versions.

Version 9.8 was released, replacing the Internet Explorer components of the internet browser with [[Chromium Embedded Framework|CEF]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://beta.aol.com/|title=Beta - Main|website=beta.aol.com|access-date=2016-07-27}}</ref> (Chromium Embedded Framework) to give users an improved web browsing experience closer to that of [[Google Chrome|Chrome]]

Version 11 of AOL Desktop, currently in Beta, is a total rewrite but maintains a similar user interface to the previous 9.8.X series of releases.<ref name="beta.aol.com" />

== Corporate social responsibility ==
Since spinning off from [[Time Warner]] in 2010, AOL has made corporate social responsibility an important part of its mission. In its company values, AOL states, "We are in the business of helping people, period."<ref>{{cite web|title=AOL Corporate Site – Our Values|url=http://corp.aol.com/our-values|accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> For the company's corporate social responsibility efforts, AOL's CEO [[Tim Armstrong (executive)|Tim Armstrong]] was included in a July 9, 2012 [[Adweek]] article, "The Givers," highlighting individuals who have committed their and their companies' time, money and resources to a diverse range of causes.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Givers|url=http://www.adweek.com/news-gallery/advertising-branding/givers-141741|publisher=Adweek|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
[[File:NoMoreAolCDs in Aachen.JPG|thumb|200px|A collection of AOL CDs sent to a student dormitory in Germany, 2002]]
In its earlier incarnation as a "[[Closed platform|walled garden]]" community and service provider, AOL received criticism for its community policies, terms of service, and customer service. Prior to 2006, AOL was known for its direct mailing of CD-ROMs and 3½" floppy disks containing its software. The disks were distributed in large numbers; at one point, half of the CDs manufactured worldwide had AOL logos on them.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/27/aol-discs-90s/ | title=Comment How Much Did It Cost AOL To Send Us Those CDs In The 90s?

=== Community leaders ===
Prior to mid-2005, AOL used [[virtual volunteering|online volunteers]] called [[AOL Community Leader Program|Community Leaders]], or CLs, to monitor chatrooms, message boards, and libraries.  AOL's use of [[virtual volunteering|remote volunteers]] dated back to the establishment of its [[Quantum Link]] service in 1985.  Most content maintenance was performed by partner and internal employees.  Community leaders were recruited for some content design and maintenance, for which they used a proprietary language and interface called RAINMAN.  Other community leaders hosted chat rooms and provided online help.  During the time that AOL customers paid by the hour, chat room hosts were compensated in free online time for each hour they worked, though of course any banked hours became worthless once fixed-rate payment was introduced.

Two former community leaders, Brian Williams of Dallas and Kelly Hallissey of New York filed a class action lawsuit against AOL, citing violations of [[United States labor law|U.S. labor laws]] in its use of community leaders.  The lawsuit was filed in the United States Federal Courthouse, New York City on May 25, 1999, and was followed shortly by the dismissal of all community leaders under the age of 18 years, as well as a reorganization of the community leader program as a whole. The [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] was also investigating AOL's alleged labor law violations, but came to no conclusion, closing their investigation in 2001.<ref name="cisn">{{cite journal

Current Community Leaders at the time were offered 12 months of credit on their accounts in thanks for their service.

Within one decade of the class action lawsuit being filed, the class had grown to over 6,000 members, comprisinging the largest class action lawsuit ever filed against an internet based company.  Currently it is the third largest class ever involved in any lawsuit on a federal level in the United States, affecting ultimately the employment eligibility of individuals in an online environment.

In February 2010, a settlement was approved by the Courts in the class action suit. The settlement included a $15&nbsp;million USD payment. This payment was then divided into thirds, the first of which was attorney and legal fees. Five Million was then divided among the included members of the class which consisted of more than 7,000 individual former Community Leaders. The final five million dollars was donated to charities hand picked by Hallissey and Williams, and then approved by the Courts for distribution.  One such charity, the [[Remote Area Medical Foundation]] (www.ramusa.org), received payments in excess of $1.2&nbsp;million USD for the provision of medical services, supplies and medication for those in need within the more rural areas of the United States and beyond.

Prior to the 1999 class action lawsuit, the community leaders were informed of a change in compensation for duties performed by AOL.  Community leaders would be charged a reduced rate per month for their accounts, and would no longer be given unlimited access without invoice.  During this live announcement via an online meeting of all community leaders in a virtual arena, Brian Williams of Dallas led many community leaders in a virtual "strike" or "sit-in" to protest the new charges the community leaders were now being asked to pay.  This protest or strike is noted as the first of its kind for an online environment and was nicknamed for the row of the arena it was held in: Row 800.  Following the protest, AOL terminated the online working relationship between itself and several of the Community Leaders involved.  Quickly following the release of these community leaders, each was reinstated, with the  exception of Williams, due to his role in the protest.  During this time, Williams' role on AOL was that of Guide XNT (Guide Program), CB Naked (Crystal Ball forum), VnV Naked (iVillage's Vices and Virtues Forum) and JCommBrian (Jewish Community Online Forum).

=== Billing disputes ===
AOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.

AOL was sued by the [[Ohio Attorney General]] in October 2003 for improper billing practices. The case was settled on June 8, 2005. AOL agreed to resolve any consumer [[complaints]] filed with the [[Ohio]] AG's office. In December 2006, AOL agreed to provide [[restitution]] to Florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the [[Florida Attorney General]].<ref name="BBB-AOL">{{cite web |url=http://www.dc.bbb.org/report.html?national=Y&compid=2087 |title=AOL |accessdate=January 22, 2008 |publisher=[[Better Business Bureau]] }}</ref>

=== Account cancellation ===
Many customers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, the [[New York Attorney General]]'s office began an inquiry of AOL's customer service policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to [[Customer retention|retain]] or "save" subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers' wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or "save" half of the people who called to cancel service.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or "save" percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum "save" rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.

On August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25&nbsp;million to the state of New York and reformed its customer service procedures. Under the agreement, AOL would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus.<ref name="BBB-AOL"/> However the agreement only covered people in the state of New York.<ref name="pcworld.com">{{cite web| title= The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time| url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/125772/worst_products_ever.html | first=Dan |last=Tynan | date= May 26, 2006 |publisher= PCWorld |accessdate= April 15, 2012 }}</ref>

On June 13, 2006, Vincent Ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/ |title=Cancelling AOL |publisher=insignificantthoughts.com |date=June 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 28, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101231075933/http://www.insignificantthoughts.com/2006/06/13/cancelling-aol/| archivedate= 31 December 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> stating he had switched to broadband years earlier. In the recorded phone call, the AOL representative refused to cancel the account unless the 30-year-old Ferrari explained why AOL hours were still being recorded on it. Ferrari insisted that AOL software was not even installed on the computer. When Ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless, the AOL representative asked to speak with Ferrari's father, for whom the account had been set up. The conversation was aired on CNBC. When CNBC reporters tried to have an account on AOL cancelled, they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than 45 minutes to cancel the account.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13447232/ |title=How hard can it be to cancel an AOL account? |first=Jane |last=Wells |publisher=CNBC |date=June 21, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060722035736/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13447232/| archivedate= 22 July 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

On July 19, 2006, AOL's entire [[Customer retention|retention]] manual was released on the Internet.<ref>Popken, Ben.

=== Direct marketing of disks ===
[[File:AOL promotional CDs in Canada.jpg|thumb|A few promotional [[CD-ROM]]s distributed in Canada.]]
Prior to 2006, AOL was infamous for the unsolicited mass [[direct mail]] of 3½" [[floppy disks]] and [[CD-ROM]]s containing their software. They were the most frequent user of this marketing tactic, and received criticism for the environmental cost of the campaign.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/TECH/internet/10/17/aol.discs/ |title=Campaign: Send AOL CDs back |publisher=CNN  |author=Rusty Dornin |date=October 18, 2002}}</ref> According to ''PC World'', in the 1990s "you couldn't open a magazine (''PC World'' included) or your mailbox without an AOL disk falling out of it".<ref name="pcworld.com"/>

The mass distribution of these disks was seen as wasteful by the public and led to protest groups.

=== Software ===
* In 2000, AOL was served with an $8&nbsp;billion lawsuit alleging that its AOL 5.0 software caused significant difficulties for users attempting to use third-party Internet service providers. The lawsuit sought damages of up to $1000 for each user that had downloaded the software cited at the time of the lawsuit. AOL later agreed to a settlement of $15&nbsp;million, without admission of wrongdoing.<ref>[http://www.gardencitygroup.com/cases/pdf/AOL/AOLNotice.pdf Gardencitygroup.com] (PDF). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.</ref> The AOL software then was given a feature called AOL Dialer, or AOL Connect on {{nowrap|[[macOS|Mac OS X]]}}. This feature allowed users to connect to the ISP without running the full interface. This allowed users to use only the applications they wish to use, especially if they do not favor the AOL Browser.
* AOL 9.0 was once identified by [[Stopbadware]] as being ''under investigation''<ref>[http://stopbadware.org/reports/reportdisplay?reportname=aol082706 Stopbadware.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220101412/http://stopbadware.org/reports/reportdisplay?reportname=aol082706 |date=February 20, 2007 }}</ref> for installing additional software without disclosure, and modifying browser preferences, toolbars, and icons. However, as of the release of AOL 9.0 VR (Vista Ready) on January 26, 2007, it was no longer considered badware due to changes AOL made in the software.<ref>[http://stopbadware.org/reports/reportdisplay?reportname=aol90vr StopBadware.org]. StopBadware.org (January 26, 2007). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.</ref>

=== Usenet newsgroups ===
When AOL gave clients access to [[Usenet]] in 1993, they hid at least one newsgroup in standard list view: ''alt.aol-sucks''. AOL did list the newsgroup in the alternative description view, but changed the description to "Flames and complaints about America Online". With AOL clients swarming [[Usenet]] newsgroups, the old, existing user base started to develop a strong distaste for both AOL and its clients, referring to the new state of affairs as [[Eternal September]].<ref>[http://www.nyupress.org/netwars/pages/chapter03/ch03_.html "The Making of an Underclass: AOL"] ''[[net.wars]]'' Chapter 3, Wendy M. Grossman, NYU Press, 1998.</ref>

AOL discontinued access to Usenet on June 25, 2005.<ref>[http://www.betanews.com/article/AOL_Pulls_Plug_on_Newsgroup_Service/1106664611 AOL Pulls Plug on Newsgroup Service]. BetaNews. Retrieved on July 8, 2011.</ref> No official details were provided as to the cause of decommissioning Usenet access, except providing users the suggestion to access Usenet services from a third-party, [[Google Groups]]. AOL then provided community-based [[Internet Forum|message boards]] in lieu of Usenet.

=== Terms of Service (TOS) ===
AOL has a detailed set of guidelines and expectations for users on their service, known as the [[Terms of Service]] (TOS, also known as Conditions of Service, or COS in the UK). It is separated into three different sections: ''Member Agreement'', ''Community Guidelines'' and ''Privacy Policy''.<ref>[http://help.channels.aol.com/kjump.adp?articleId=221224 AOL Member Agreement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102134253/http://help.channels.aol.com/kjump.adp?articleId=221224 |date=November 2, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://help.aol.co.uk/conditions-of-service/article/20060802090809990001 Conditions of Service – AOL Help<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> All three agreements are presented to users at time of registration and digital acceptance is achieved when they access the AOL service. During the period when volunteer chat room hosts and board monitors were used, chat room hosts were given a brief online training session and test on Terms of Service violations.

There have been many complaints over rules that govern an AOL user's conduct. Some users disagree with the TOS, citing the guidelines are too strict to follow coupled with the fact the TOS may change without users being made aware. A considerable cause for this was likely due to alleged censorship of user-generated content during the earlier years of growth for AOL.<ref>[http://www.aolwatch.org/censory.htm Aolwatch.org].

=== Certified email ===
In early 2005, AOL stated its intention to implement a [[certified email]] system called Goodmail, which will allow companies to send email to users with whom they have pre-existing business relationships, with a visual indication that the email is from a trusted source and without the risk that the email messages might be blocked or stripped by [[spam filter]]s.

This decision drew fire from [[MoveOn]], which characterized the program as an "email tax", and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]], which characterized it as a shakedown of non-profits.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004398.php | title=AOL, Yahoo and Goodmail: Taxing Your Email for Fun and Profit | author=[[Cindy Cohn]] |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] |date=February 8, 2006}}</ref>  A website called Dearaol.com<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dearaol.com/ |title=Stop AOL's Email Tax |publisher=dearaol.com |accessdate=November 28, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104175854/http://www.dearaol.com/ |archivedate=January 4, 2007}}</ref> was launched, with an online petition and a blog that garnered hundreds of signatures from people and organizations expressing their opposition to AOL's use of Goodmail.

[[Esther Dyson]] defended the move in a ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial saying "I hope Goodmail succeeds, and that it has lots of competition. I also think it and its competitors will eventually transform into services that more directly serve the interests of mail recipients. Instead of the fees going to Goodmail and EON, they will also be shared with the individual recipients."<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/17/opinion/17dyson.html?ex=1300251600&en=04138dcf8237c907&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |title=You've Got Goodmail | author=[[Esther Dyson|Dyson, Esther]] |work=New York Times |date=March 17, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2006 }}</ref>

Other members of the antispam and blogging community were broadly critical of [[MoveOn.org]] and the EFF's attempts to characterize this as a "shakedown".{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Tim Lee of the Technology Liberation Front<ref>[http://www.techliberation.com/archives/038303.php Techliberation.com]. Techliberation.com. Retrieved on July 8, 2011.</ref> posted an article that questioned the EFF's adopting a confrontational posture when dealing with private companies. Lee's article cited a series of discussions<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politechbot.com/2006/04/15/debate-over-dearaolcom/ | title = Debate over DearAOL.com between Suresh Ramasubramanian and Danny O'Brien |publisher=politechbot.com |accessdate=November 28, 2010}}</ref> on [[Declan McCullagh]]'s Politechbot mailing list on this subject between the EFF's Danny O'Brien and antispammer Suresh Ramasubramanian, who has also compared<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/eff_use_of_propaganda_karl_rove/ |title=EFF and Its Use of Propaganda: Could Karl Rove do better?

[[Spamassassin]] developer Justin Mason posted some criticism of the EFF's and Moveon's "going overboard" in their opposition to the scheme.

The dearaol.com campaign lost momentum and disappeared, with the last post to the now defunct dearaol.com blog—"AOL starts the shakedown" being made on May 9, 2006.

[[Comcast]], who also used the service, announced on its website that Goodmail had ceased operations and as of February 4, 2011 they no longer used the service.<ref>[http://security.comcast.net/certifiedemail/?cid=NET_33_1210&fss=certified%20email Security.comcast.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319210144/http://security.comcast.net/certifiedemail/?cid=NET_33_1210&fss=certified%20email |date=March 19, 2012 }}, February 4, 2011</ref>

=== Search data ===
{{Main article|AOL search data scandal}}

On August 4, 2006, AOL released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing 20 million search [[Index term|keywords]] for over 650,000 users over a 3-month period between March 1, 2006 and May 31, intended for research purposes. AOL pulled the file from public access by August 7, but not before its wide distribution on the Internet by others. Derivative research, titled ''A Picture of Search''<ref>[http://www.ir.iit.edu/~abdur/publications/pos-infoscale.pdf IR.iit.edu]. (PDF) . Retrieved on July 8, 2011.</ref> was published by authors Pass, Chowdhury and Torgeson for The First International Conference on Scalable Information Systems.<ref>[http://www.cs.hku.hk/infoscale06/ CS.hku.hk]. CS.hku.hk. Retrieved on July 8, 2011.</ref>

The data were used by websites such as AOLstalker<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aolstalker.com |title=AOLstalker homepage }}</ref> for entertainment purposes, where users of AOLstalker are encouraged to judge AOL clients based on the humorousness of personal details revealed by search behavior.

=== User list exposure ===
In 2003, Jason Smathers, an AOL employee, was convicted of stealing America Online's 92 million screen names and selling them to a known spammer.

=== AOL's Computer Checkup "scareware" ===
On February 27, 2012 a [[class action lawsuit]] was filed against [[Support.com]], Inc. and partner [[AOL, Inc.]] The lawsuit alleged Support.com and AOL's Computer Checkup "[[scareware]]" (which uses software developed by Support.com) misrepresented that their software programs would identify and resolve a host of technical problems with computers, offered to perform a free “scan,” which often found problems with users' computers. The companies then offered to sell software—for which AOL allegedly charged $4.99 a month and Support.com $29—to remedy those problems.<ref name=MediaPost>{{cite news | url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/200692/aol-supportcom-settle-scareware-lawsuit-for-85.html | title=AOL, Support.Com Settle Scareware Lawsuit For $8.5 Million | work=MediaPost | date=May 20, 2013 | accessdate=October 7, 2014 | author=Davis, Wendy}}</ref> Both AOL, Inc. and Support.com, Inc. settled on May 30, 2013 for $8.5 million.

===NSA Prism program===
Following media reports about [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], NSA's massive electronic [[Mass surveillance|surveillance program]], in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including AOL.
