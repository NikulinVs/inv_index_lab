The animistic perspective is so widely held and inherent to most animistic indigenous peoples that they often do not even have a word in their languages that corresponds to "animism" (or even "religion");<ref>{{cite web|title=Native American Religious and Cultural Freedom: An Introductory Essay|work=The Pluralism Project|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College and Diana Eck|year=2005|url=http://www.pluralism.org/reports/view/176}}</ref> the term is an [[Emic and etic|anthropological construct]].

Largely due to such [[ethnolinguistic]] and cultural discrepancies, opinion has differed on whether ''animism'' refers to a broad religious belief or to a full-fledged religion in its own right. The currently accepted definition of animism was only developed in the late 19th century by Sir [[Edward Tylor]], who created it as "one of [[anthropology]]'s earliest concepts, if not the first".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title="Animism" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|page=S67|doi=10.1086/200061}}</ref>

Animism encompasses the beliefs that there is no separation between the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and physical (or material) world, and that [[Soul (spirit)|souls]] or [[spirit]]s exist, not only in humans, but also in some other animals, plants, rocks, geographic features such as mountains or rivers, or other entities of the natural environment, including thunder, wind, and shadows. Animism thus rejects [[Cartesian dualism]]. Animism may further attribute souls to abstract concepts such as words, [[true name]]s, or metaphors in [[mythology]]. Some members of the non-tribal world also consider themselves animists (such as author [[Daniel Quinn]], sculptor [[Lawson Oyekan]], and many contemporary [[Modern Paganism|Pagans]]).<ref name="Harvey">{{cite book|title=Animism: Respecting the Living World|last=Harvey|first=Graham|page=9|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q2np2LCDmIMC&printsec=frontcover|isbn=978-0-231-13700-3}}</ref>

== Theories of animism ==

=== Old animism ===

Earlier anthropological perspectives – since termed the "old animism" – were concerned with knowledge surrounding what is alive and what factors make something alive.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}}
The "old animism" assumed that animists were individuals who were unable to understand the difference between [[persons]] and [[Object (philosophy)|things]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xiv}}
Critics of the "old animism" have accused it of preserving "colonialist and dualist worldviews and rhetoric".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}}

==== Edward Tylor's definition ====
[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Tylor]] developed animism as an anthropological theory]]

The idea of animism was developed by the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Sir Edward Tylor]] in his 1871 book ''Primitive Culture'',{{sfnp|EB|1878}} in which he defined it as "the general doctrine of souls and other spiritual beings in general." According to Tylor, animism often includes "an idea of pervading life and will in nature";<ref>{{cite book| author = Sir Edward Burnett Tylor| title = Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom| url = https://books.google.com/?id=AucLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA260| year = 1871| publisher = J. Murray| isbn = | page = 260 }}</ref> i.e., a belief that natural objects other than humans have souls. This formulation was little different from that proposed by [[Auguste Comte]] as "[[fetishism]]",<ref name="Kuper 2005 85">{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=Reinvention of Primitive Society: Transformations of a Myth (2nd Edition)|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=Florence, KY, USA|page=85}}</ref> although the terms now have distinct terms.

For Tylor, animism represented the earliest form of religion, being situated within an evolutionary framework of religion which has developed in stages and which will ultimately lead to humanity rejecting religion altogether in favor of scientific rationality.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=6}}
Thus, for Tylor, animism was fundamentally seen as a mistake, a basic error from which all religion grew.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=6}} He did not believe that animism was inherently illogical, but suggested that it arose from early humans' dreams and visions, and thus while being a rational system, it was based on erroneous, un-scientific observations about the nature of reality.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=8}} Stringer notes that his reading of ''Primitive Culture'' led him to believe that Tylor was far more sympathetic in regard to “primitive” populations than many of his contemporaries, and that Tylor expressed no belief that there was any difference between the intellectual capabilities of  “savage” people and Westerners.<ref name=stringer />

Tylor had initially wanted to describe this phenomenon as "spiritualism," however he decided against this upon recognizing that it would cause confusion with the modern religion of [[Spiritualism]] which was prevalent across Western nations during his own time.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=7}} He adopted the term "animism" from the writings of the German scientist [[Georg Ernst Stahl]],{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=5}} who, in 1708, had developed the term ''{{lang|la|animismus}}'' as a [[biology|biological]] theory that [[soul (spirit)|souls]] formed the [[vital principle]] and that the normal phenomena of life and the abnormal phenomena of disease could be traced to spiritual causes.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=3–4}} The earliest known usage in English appeared in 1819.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title="Animism" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|pages=S67–S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}</ref>

The idea that there had once been "one universal form of primitive religion" – whether labelled "animism", "totemism", or "shamanism" – has been dismissed as "unsophisticated" and "erroneous" by the archaeologist [[Timothy Insoll]], who stated that "it removes complexity, a precondition of religion now, in ''all'' its variants".{{sfn|Insoll|2004|p=29}}

==== Social evolutionist conceptions ====
Tylor's definition of animism was a part of a growing international debate on the nature of 'primitive society' by lawyers, theologians, and philologists. The debate defined the field of research of a new science – anthropology. By the end of the nineteenth century, an orthodoxy on 'primitive society' had emerged, although few anthropologists today would accept their definition; the 'nineteenth century armchair anthropologists' argued 'primitive society' (an evolutionary category) was ordered by kinship and was divided into exogamous [[Kinship|descent groups]] related by a series of marriage exchanges. Their religion was animism – the belief that natural species and objects had souls. With the development of private property, these descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of "developed" religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced a society became, the fewer members of that society believed in animism; however, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented "survivals" of the original animism of early humanity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kuper|first=Adam|title=The Invention of Primitive Society: Transformations of an Illusion|year=1988|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=London|pages=6–7}}</ref>

In 1869 (three years after Tylor proposed his definition of animism), the Edinburgh lawyer, John Ferguson McLellan, argued that the animistic thinking evident in [[fetishism]] gave rise to a religion he named [[Totemism]]. Primitive people believed, he argued, that they were descended of the same species as their totemic animal.<ref name="Kuper 2005 85" /> Subsequent debate by the 'armchair anthropologists' (including [[Johann Jakob Bachofen|J. J. Bachofen]], [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]) remained focused on [[totemism]] rather than animism, with few directly challenging Tylor's definition. Indeed, anthropologists "have commonly avoided the issue of Animism and even the term itself rather than revisit this prevalent notion in light of their new and rich [[ethnographies]]."<ref name="Bird-David 1999 S68">{{cite journal|last=Bird-David|first=Nurit|title="Animism" Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational Epistemology|journal=Current Anthropology|year=1999|volume=40|issue=S1|page=S68|doi=10.1086/200061}}</ref>

According to the anthropologist [[Tim Ingold]], animism shares similarities to totemism but differs in its focus on individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life, whereas totemism more typically holds that there is a primary source, such as the land itself or the ancestors, who provide the basis to life. Certain indigenous religious groups such as the [[Australian Aboriginals]] are more typically totemic, whereas others like the [[Inuit]] are more typically animistic in their worldview.<ref>Ingold, Tim. (2000). "Totemism, Animism and the Depiction of Animals" in ''The Perception of the Environment: Essays on Livelihood, Dwelling and Skill''. London: Routledge, pp.&nbsp;112–113.</ref>

From his studies into child development, [[Jean Piaget]] suggested that children were born with an innate animist worldview in which they anthropomorphized inanimate objects, and that it was only later that they grew out of this belief.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=14}} Conversely, from her ethnographic research, [[Margaret Mead]] argued the opposite, believing that children were not born with an animist worldview but that they became acculturated to such beliefs as they were educated by their society.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=14}}
Stewart Guthrie saw animism – or "attribution" as he preferred it – as an evolutionary strategy to aid survival. He argued that both humans and other animal species view inanimate objects as potentially alive as a means of being constantly on guard against potential threats.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=15}} His suggested explanation, however, did not deal with the question of why such a belief became central to religion.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=16}}

In 2000, Guthrie suggested that the "most widespread" concept of animism was that it was the "attribution of spirits to natural phenomena
such as stones and trees".{{sfn|Guthrie|2000|p=106}}

=== New animism ===

Many anthropologists ceased using the term "animism", deeming it to be too close to early anthropological theory and religious polemic.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} However, the term had also been claimed by religious groups – namely indigenous communities and [[nature worship]]ers – who felt that it aptly described their own beliefs, and who in some cases actively identified as "animists".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=xii, 3}} It was thus readopted by various scholars, however they began using the term in a different way,{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xii}} placing the focus on knowing how to behave toward other persons, some of whom aren't human.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} As the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated, while the "old animist" definition had been problematic, the term "animism" was nevertheless "of considerable value as a critical, academic term for a style of religious and cultural relating to the world."{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xv}}

[[File:Hombres ojibwe.jpg|thumb|left|Five [[Ojibwe]] chiefs in the 19th century; it was anthropological studies of Ojibwe religion that resulted in the development of the "new animism"]]
The "new animism" emerged largely from the publications of the anthropologist [[Alfred Irving Hallowell|Irving Hallowell]] which were produced on the basis of his ethnographic research among the [[Ojibwe]] communities of Canada in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=17}} For the Ojibwe encountered by Hallowell, ''[[personhood]]'' did not require human-likeness, but rather humans were perceived as being like other persons, who for instance included rock persons and bear persons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} For the Ojibwe, these persons were each wilful beings who gained meaning and power through their interactions with others; through respectfully interacting with other persons, they themselves learned to "act as a person".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}} Hallowell's approach to the understanding of Ojibwe personhood differed strongly from prior anthropological concepts of animism.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=19}} He emphasized the need to challenge the modernist, Western perspectives of what a person is by entering into a dialogue with different worldwide-views.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=18}}

Hallowell's approach influenced the work of anthropologist Nurit Bird-David, who produced a [[Academic journal#Scholarly articles|scholarly article]] reassessing the idea of animism in 1999.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=20}} Seven comments from other academics were provided in the journal, debating Bird-David's ideas.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=21}}

More recently post-modern anthropologists are increasingly engaging with the concept of animism. Modernism is characterized by a Cartesian subject-object dualism that divides the subjective from the objective, and culture from nature; in this view, Animism is the inverse of [[scientism]], and hence inherently invalid. Drawing on the work of [[Bruno Latour]], these anthropologists question these modernist assumptions, and theorize that all societies continue to "animate" the world around them, and not just as a Tylorian survival of primitive thought. Rather, the instrumental reason characteristic of modernity is limited to our "professional subcultures," which allows us to treat the world as a detached mechanical object in a delimited sphere of activity. We, like animists, also continue to create personal relationships with elements of the so-called objective world, whether pets, cars or teddy-bears, who we recognize as subjects. As such, these entities are "approached as communicative subjects rather than the inert objects perceived by modernists."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hornborg|first=Alf|title=Animism, fetishism, and objectivism as strategies for knowing (or not knowing) the world|journal=Ethnos|year=2006|volume=71|issue=1|pages=22–4|doi=10.1080/00141840600603129}}</ref> These approaches are careful to avoid the modernist assumptions that the environment consists dichotomously of a physical world distinct from humans, and from modernist conceptions of the person as composed dualistically as body and soul.<ref name="Bird-David 1999 S68" />

Nurit Bird-David argues that "Positivistic ideas about the meaning of 'nature', 'life' and 'personhood' misdirected these previous attempts to understand the local concepts. Classical theoreticians (it is argued) attributed their own modernist ideas of self to 'primitive peoples' while asserting that the 'primitive peoples' read their idea of self into others!"<ref name="Bird-David 1999 S68" /> She argues that animism is a "relational epistemology", and not a Tylorian failure of primitive reasoning. That is, self-identity among animists is based on their relationships with others, rather than some distinctive feature of the self. Instead of focusing on the essentialized, modernist self (the "individual"), persons are viewed as bundles of social relationships ("dividuals"), some of which are with "superpersons" (i.e. non-humans).

Tim Ingold, like Bird-David, argues that animists do not see themselves as separate from their environment: "Hunter-gatherers do not, as a rule, approach their environment as an external world of nature that has to be 'grasped' intellectually&nbsp;... indeed the separation of mind and nature has no place in their thought and practice."<ref>{{cite book|last=Ingold|first=Tim|title=The Perception of the Environment: Essays in Livelihood, Dwelling and Skill|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=42}}</ref> Willerslev extends the argument by noting that animists reject this [[Cartesian dualism]], and that the animist self identifies with the world, "feeling at once ''within'' and ''apart'' from it so that the two glide ceaselessly in and out of each other in a sealed circuit."<ref>{{cite book|last=Willerslev|first=Rane|title=Soul Hunters: Hunting, Animism and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=24}}</ref> The animist hunter is thus aware of himself as a human hunter, but, through mimicry is able to assume the viewpoint, senses, and sensibilities of his prey, to be one with it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Willerslev|first=Rane|title=Soul Hunters: Hunting, Animism and personhood among the Siberian Yukaghirs|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=27}}</ref> [[Shamanism]], in this view, is an everyday attempt to influence spirits of ancestors and animals by mirroring their behaviours as the hunter does his prey.

The religious studies scholar Graham Harvey defined animism as the belief "that the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human, and that life is always lived in relationship with others".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}} He added that it is therefore "concerned with learning how to be a good person in respectful relationships with other persons".{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xi}}
Graham Harvey, in his 2013 Handbook of Contemporary Animism, identifies the animist perspective in line with Martin Buber's "I-thou" as opposed to "I-it". In such, Harvey says, the Animist takes an I-thou approach to relating to his world, where objects and animals are treated as a "thou" rather than as an "it".<ref>{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=Graham|title=The Handbook of Contemporary Animism|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}</ref>

Guthrie expressed criticism of Bird-David's attitude toward animism, believing that it promulgated the view that "the world is in large measure whatever our local imagination makes it". This, he felt, would result in anthropology abandoning "the scientific project".{{sfn|Guthrie|2000|p=107}}

=== Fetishism/totemism ===

{{Main article|Fetishism|Totemism}}
In many animistic world views, the human being is often regarded as on a roughly equal footing with other animals, plants, and natural forces.<ref>Fernandez-Armesto, p. 138.</ref>

=== Shamanism ===

{{Main article|Shamanism}}
A shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of [[Evocation|benevolent and malevolent spirits]], who typically enters into a [[trance]] state during a [[ritual]], and practices [[divination]] and [[healing]].<ref>[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/shaman?view=uk Oxford Dictionary Online].</ref> Shamanism encompasses the premise that shamans are intermediaries or messengers between the human world and the spirit worlds. Shamans are said to treat ailments/illness by mending the soul. Alleviating traumas affecting the soul/spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness. The shaman also enters [[otherworld|supernatural realms]] or [[Plane (esotericism)|dimensions]] to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community. Shamans may visit other worlds/dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements. The shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world, which in turn affects the human world. The restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment.<ref name = Eli72>Mircea Eliade, ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Princeton University Press 1972, pp. 3–7.</ref>

=== Distinction from pantheism ===
Animism is not the same as [[pantheism]], although the two are sometimes confused. Some religions are both pantheistic and animistic. One of the main differences is that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united (monism), the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits and/or souls.<ref>Paul A. Harrison ''Elements of Pantheism'' 2004, p. 11</ref><ref>Carl McColman ''When Someone You Love Is Wiccan: A Guide to Witchcraft and Paganism for Concerned Friends, Nervous parents and Curious Co-Workers'' 2002, p. 97</ref>

== Animist life ==

=== Animals, plants, and the elements ===

Animism entails the belief that "all living things have a soul", and thus a central concern of animist thought surrounds how animals can be eaten or otherwise used for humans' subsistence needs.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=99}} The actions of non-human animals are viewed as "intentional, planned and purposive",{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=101}} and they are understood to be persons because they are both alive and communicate with others.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=100}} In animist world-views, non-human animals are understood to participate in [[kinship]] systems and ceremonies with humans, as well as having their own kinship systems and ceremonies.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=102}} Harvey cited an example of an animist understanding of animal behaviour that occurred at a [[powwow]] held by the [[Conne River]] [[Mi'kmaq]] in 1996; an eagle flew over the proceedings, circling over the central drum group. The assembled participants called out ''kitpu'' ("eagle"), conveying welcome to the bird and expressing pleasure at its beauty, and they later articulated the view that the eagle's actions reflected its approval of the event and the Mi'kmaq's return to traditional spiritual practices.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=102–103}}

Some animists also view plant and fungi life as persons and interact with them accordingly.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=104}} The most common encounter between humans and these plant and fungi persons is with the former's collection of the latter for food, and for animists this interaction typically has to be carried out respectfully.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=106}} Harvey cited the example of Maori communities in New Zealand, who often offer ''[[karakia]]'' invocations to [[sweet potatoes]] as they dig the latter up; while doing so there is an awareness of a kinship relationship between the Maori and the sweet potatoes, with both understood as having arrived in [[Aotearoa]] together in the same canoes.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=106}} In other instances, animists believe that interaction with plant and fungi persons can result in the communication of things unknown or even otherwise unknowable.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=104}} Among some modern Pagans, for instance, relationships are cultivated with specific trees, who are understood to bestow knowledge or physical gifts, such as flowers, sap, or wood that can be used as firewood or to fashion into a [[wand]]; in return, these Pagans give offerings to the tree itself, which can come in the form of [[libation]]s of mead or ale, a drop of blood from a finger, or a strand of wool.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=104–105}}

Various animistic cultures also comprehend as stones as persons.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=106–107}} Discussing ethnographic work conducted among the Ojibwe, Harvey noted that their society generally conceived of stones as being inanimate, but with two notable exceptions: the stones of the [[Bell Rocks]] and those stones which are situated beneath trees struck by lightning, which were understood to have become Thunderers themselves.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=107}} The Ojibwe conceived of weather as being capable of having personhood, with storms being conceived of as persons known as 'Thunderers' whose sounds conveyed communications and who engaged in seasonal conflict over the lakes and forests, throwing lightning at lake monsters.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=107}} Wind, similarly, can be conceived as a person in animistic thought.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|pp=108–109}}

The importance of place is also a recurring element of animism, with some places being understood to be persons in their own right.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=109}}

=== Spirits ===

Animism can also entail relationships being established with non-corporeal [[spirit]] entities.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=122}}

== Other usages ==

=== Science and animism ===
In the early 20th century, [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] defended a form of Animism in his book ''Body and Mind: A History and Defence of Animism'' (1911).

The physicist [[Nick Herbert (physicist)|Nick Herbert]] has argued for "quantum animism" in which mind permeates the world at every level.
{{blockquote|The quantum consciousness assumption, which amounts to a kind of "quantum animism" likewise asserts that consciousness is an integral part of the physical world, not an emergent property of special biological or computational systems. Since everything in the world is on some level a quantum system, this assumption requires that everything be conscious on that level. If the world is truly quantum animated, then there is an immense amount of invisible inner experience going on all around us that is presently inaccessible to humans, because our own inner lives are imprisoned inside a small quantum system, isolated deep in the meat of an animal brain.<ref>{{cite web|first=Nick|last= Herbert|authorlink=Nick Herbert (physicist)|title= Holistic Physics – or – An Introduction to Quantum Tantra|date=2002|accessdate=2014-05-01 |url=http://www.southerncrossreview.org/16/herbert.essay.htm|publisher=southerncrossreview.org}}</ref>}}

[[Werner Krieglstein]] wrote regarding his quantum Animism:
{{blockquote|Herbert's quantum Animism differs from traditional Animism in that it avoids assuming a dualistic model of mind and matter. Traditional dualism assumes that some kind of spirit inhabits a body and makes it move, a ghost in the machine. Herbert's quantum Animism presents the idea that every natural system has an inner life, a conscious center, from which it directs and observes its action.<ref>Werner J. Krieglstein ''Compassion: A New Philosophy of the Other'' 2002, p. 118</ref>}}

=== Socio-political impact ===

Harvey opined that animism's views on personhood represented a radical challenge to the dominant perspectives of [[modernity]], because it accords "intelligence, rationality, consciousness, volition, agency, intentionality, language and desire" to non-humans.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xviii}} Similarly, it challenges the view of human uniqueness that is prevalent in both [[Abrahamic religion]]s and Western [[rationalism]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xix}}

=== In art and literature ===

Animist beliefs can also be expressed through artwork.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=50}} For instance, among the Maori communities of New Zealand, there is an acknowledgment that creating art through carving wood or stone entails violence against the wood or stone person, and that the persons who are damaged therefore have to be placated and respected during the process; any excess or waste from the creation of the artwork is returned to the land, while the artwork itself is treated with particular respect.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=55}} Harvey therefore argued that the creation of art among the Maori was not about creating an inanimate object for display, but rather a transformation of different persons within a relationship.{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=64}}

Harvey expressed the view that animist worldviews were present in various works of literature, citing such examples as the writings of [[Alan Garner]], [[Leslie Silko]], [[Barbara Kingsolver]], [[Alice Walker]], [[Daniel Quinn]], [[David Abram]], [[Linda Hogan]], [[Patricia Grace]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Ursula Le Guin]], [[Louise Erdrich]], and [[Marge Piercy]].{{sfn|Harvey|2005|p=xxiii}}
