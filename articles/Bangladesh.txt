==Etymology==
{{Main article|Names of Bengal}}
The name ''Bangladesh'' was originally written as two words, ''Bangla Desh''. Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term in political rallies in [[East Pakistan]]. The term ''Bangla'' is a major name for both the [[Bengal]] region and the [[Bengali language]]. The earliest references to the term date to the Nesari plate in 805&nbsp;AD. The term "Vangaladesa" is found in South Indian records in the 11th century.<ref name="auto1">Keay, John (2011) ''India: A History''. Grove Press.

Bengal was ruled by the [[Mauryan Empire]] in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE. With their bastions in the Bengal and [[Bihar]] regions (collectively known as [[Magadha]]), the Mauryans built the first [[Greater India|geographically extensive]] [[Iron Age]] empire in [[Ancient India]]. They promoted [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The empire reached its peak under emperor [[Ashoka]]. They were eventually succeeded by the [[Gupta Empire]] in the 3rd century.

In [[Classical India|classical antiquity]], Bengal was divided between various kingdoms. The [[Pala Empire]] stood out as the largest Bengali state established in ancient history, with an empire covering most of the north Indian subcontinent at its height in the 9th century. The Palas were devout [[Mahayana Buddhist]]s. They strongly patronized art, architecture and education, giving rise to the Pala School of Painting and Sculptural Art,<ref>{{cite book |last=Bagchi |first=Jhunu |date=1993 |title=The History and Culture of the Pālas of Bengal and Bihar, Cir. 750 A.D.-cir. 1200 A.D. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7RKoMeAtpUC&pg=PA127 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |pages=127– |isbn=978-81-7017-301-4}}</ref> the [[Somapura Mahavihara]] and the universities of [[Nalanda]] and [[Vikramshila]].

The sultanate was visited by numerous world explorers, including [[Niccolò de' Conti]] of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Ibn Battuta]] of [[Morocco]] and [[Admiral Zheng He]] of China. However, by the 16th century, the Bengal Sultanate began to disintegrate. The [[Sur Empire]] overran Bengal in 1532 and built the [[Grand Trunk Road]]. [[Hindu]] [[Raja]]s and the [[Baro-Bhuyan]] [[zamindar]]s gained control of large parts of the region, especially in the fertile [[Bhati]] zone.

The Mughals faced stiff resistance from the Baro-Bhuyans, Afghan warlords and zamindars, but were ultimately successful in conquering the whole of Bengal by 1666, when the [[Porto Grande De Bengala|Portuguese]] and Arakanese were expelled from Chittagong. Mughal rule ushered economic prosperity, agrarian reform and flourishing external trade, particularly in [[muslin]] and silk textiles. Mughal Viceroys promoted agricultural expansion and turned Bengal into the rice basket of the Indian subcontinent. The [[Sufi]]s gained increasing prominence. The [[Baul]] movement, inspired by Sufism, also emerged under Mughal rule. The Bengali ethnic identity further crystallized during this period, and the region's inhabitants were given sufficient autonomy to cultivate their own customs and literature.

As a result of growing demands for educational development in East Bengal, the British [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partitioned Bengal]] in 1905 and created the administrative division of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]]. Based in [[Dacca]], with [[Shillong]] as the summer capital and [[Chittagong]] as the chief port, the new province covered much of the northeastern subcontinent. The [[All India Muslim League]] was formed in Dacca in 1906 and emerged as the standard bearer of Muslims in British India. The partition of Bengal outraged nationalist [[Hindu]]s and anti-British Muslims, leading to the [[Swadeshi movement]] by the [[Indian National Congress]]. The partition was annulled in 1911 after a long civil disobedience campaign by the Congress. The [[Indian Independence Movement]] enjoyed strong momentum in the Bengal region, including the [[Pakistan Movement|constitutional struggle]] for the rights of Muslim minorities.

The [[Freedom of Intellect Movement]] thrived in the [[University of Dacca]]. By the 1930s, the [[Krishak Praja Party]] led by [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] and the [[Swaraj Party]] led by [[Chittaranjan Das|C. R. Das]] came to represent the new Bengali middle class. Huq became the [[Prime Minister of Bengal]] in 1937. With the breakdown of [[Hindu]]-[[Muslim]] unity in the British Raj, Huq allied with the Muslim League to present the [[Lahore Resolution]] in 1940, which envisioned independent states in the eastern and northwestern subcontinent.

The [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] formed a parliamentary government in Bengal in 1943, with Sir [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]] and later [[H. S. Suhrawardy]] as its premiers. At the [[Indian provincial elections, 1946]], the decisive victory of the Bengal Muslim League set the course for the [[Partition of British India]] and the creation of the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] on 14 August 1947. [[Colonial Assam|Assam]] was partitioned in order to allow Bengali-speaking [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]] to join [[East Bengal]]. There was also an unsuccessful attempt to form a [[United Bengal]]. The [[Radcliffe Line]] divided Bengal on religious grounds, ceding Hindu-majority districts to the Indian dominion, and making Muslim-majority districts the eastern wing of Pakistan.

Mushtaq [[Internment|interned]] four prominent associates of Mujib, including Bangladesh's first prime minister [[Tajuddin Ahmad]]. Two Army uprisings on 3 and 7 November 1975 led to a reorganised structure of power.

Lieutenant General [[Ziaur Rahman]] took over the presidency in 1977 when Justice Sayem resigned. In 1979, President Zia reinstated multi-party politics and restored civilian rule.

An [[Chittagong Hill Tracts conflict|insurgency]] began in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]], due to demands by the region's indigenous people for [[autonomy]].

Bangladesh's next major ruler was Lieutenant General [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]].

At the [[Bangladeshi general election, 1996|next election in 1996]], the [[Awami League]], headed by [[Sheikh Hasina]], one of Mujib's surviving daughters, returned to power after 21 years. Hasina ended the Chittagong Hill Tracts insurgency after a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord|peace accord]] with [[Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti|PCJSS]] rebels. She also secured a treaty with India on [[sharing the water of the Ganges]]. Hasina held a [[Delhi Agreement|trilateral]] economic summit between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh in 1999 and helped establish the [[Developing 8 Countries|D8 grouping]] with [[Turkey]].<ref name="auto6"/> The [[economy of Bangladesh|economy]] took a downturn with a depletion of foreign exchange reserves.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/398413.stm|title=BBC News - South Asia - Controversy greets Bangladesh devaluation|publisher=}}</ref> Hasina also refused to export Bangladesh's natural gas, despite major investment offers from international oil companies. The Awami League lost again to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party in the [[Bangladeshi general election, 2001|2001 election]].

The economy picked up steam from 2003, with a GDP growth rate of 6% in spite of the 2005 floods. Zia faced criticism for her alliance with the [[Jamaat-e-Islami]], which was accused of war crimes in 1971, and accusations against her son [[Tarique Rahman]] of corruption. The Awami League waged a series of strikes against the government after an assassination attempt on former premier Sheikh Hasina. Widespread political unrest followed the end of the BNP's tenure in late October 2006. A [[caretaker government]] led by the pro-BNP President [[Iajuddin Ahmed]] worked to bring the parties to election within the required ninety days, but was accused by opposition parties of being biased. At the last minute, the Awami League announced an election boycott.

On 11 January 2007, the [[Bangladesh Armed Forces]] intervened to support both a [[2006-2008 Bangladeshi political crisis|state of emergency]] and a continuing but neutral caretaker government under a newly appointed [[Chief Advisor]] [[Fakhruddin Ahmed]], the former governor of the [[Bangladesh Bank]]. Ahmed strengthened the [[Anti Corruption Commission Bangladesh|Anti Corruption Commission]] and launched an anti-graft drive, detaining more than 160 people, including politicians, civil servants, businessmen and two sons of Khaleda Zia.

==Geography==
{{Main article|Geography of Bangladesh}}
[[File:Bg-map.png|thumb|A map of Bangladesh]]
The geography of Bangladesh is divided between three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile [[Ganges-Brahmaputra delta]]. The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the [[Madhupur tract|Madhupur]] and the [[Barind Tract|Barind]] plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to [[evergreen]] hill ranges. The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name [[Padma River|Padma]] or ''Pôdda''), [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] ([[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] or ''Jomuna''), and [[Meghna River|Meghna]] rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The [[Alluvium|alluvial soil]] deposited by the rivers when they overflow their banks has created some of the most fertile plains in the world. Bangladesh has 57 [[trans-boundary river]]s, making water issues politically complicated to resolve&nbsp;– in most cases as the lower [[riparian zone|riparian]] state to India.<ref>{{cite book | last = Suvedī | first = Sūryaprasāda | title = International watercourses law for the 21st century | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | year = 2005 | pages = 154–166 | isbn = 0-7546-4527-4}}</ref>

Bangladesh is predominately rich fertile flat land. Most parts of Bangladesh are less than {{convert|12|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} above sea level, and it is estimated that about 10% of the land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by {{convert|1|m|ft|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="ali">{{cite journal|last=Ali |first=A |year=1996 |title=Vulnerability of Bangladesh to climate change and sea level rise through tropical cyclones and storm surges |doi = 10.1007/BF00175563|journal=Water, Air, & Soil Pollution |volume=92 |issue=1–2 |pages=171–179}} {{Dead link |date=December 2016}}</ref> 17% of the country is covered by forests and 12% is covered by hill systems. The country's [[haor]] wetlands are of significant importance to global environmental science.

In southeastern Bangladesh, experiments have been done since the 1960s to 'build with nature'. Construction of cross dams has induced a natural accretion of silt, creating new land. With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began promoting the development of this new land in the late 1970s. The effort has become a multi-agency endeavor, building roads, culverts, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers. By fall 2010, the program will have allotted some {{convert|27000|acre|ha|0|abbr=on}} to 21,000 families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/articles/bangladesh-fights-survival-against-climate-change|title="Bangladesh fights for survival against climate change", by William Wheeler and Anna-Katarina Gravgaard, The Washington Times |publisher=Pulitzercenter.org |accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref>

In September 1998, Bangladesh saw [[1998 Bangladesh floods|the most severe flooding]] in modern world history. As the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and [[Meghna]] spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses, {{convert|9700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of road and {{convert|2700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of embankment, 1,000&nbsp;people were killed and 30&nbsp;million more were made homeless, with 135,000 cattle killed, {{convert|50|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of land destroyed and {{convert|11000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of roads damaged or destroyed. Two-thirds of the country was underwater.
There were several reasons for the severity of the flooding. Firstly, there were unusually high [[monsoon]] rains. Secondly, the [[Himalayas]] shed off an equally unusually high amount of melt water that year. Thirdly, trees that usually would have intercepted rain water had been cut down for firewood or to make space for animals.<ref name="EWG">{{cite book |last=Haggett|first=Peter |title= Encyclopedia of World Geography |url= https://books.google.com/?id=IROIY4ONOSEC&pg=PA2634|accessdate=2 May 2008 |publisher= Marshall Cavendish |year= 2002|location= New York |isbn=0-7614-7308-4 |oclc= 46578454|pages=2, 634 |chapter=The Indian Subcontinent |origyear=2002 }}</ref>

Several animals became extinct in Bangladesh during the last century, including the one horned and two horned [[rhinoceros]] and common [[peafowl]]. The human population is concentrated in urban areas, hence limiting deforestation to a certain extent. Rapid urban growth has threatened natural habitats. Though many areas are protected under law, a large portion of Bangladeshi wildlife is threatened by this growth. The [[Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act]] was enacted in 1995. The government has designated several regions as [[Ecologically Critical Area]]s, including wetlands, forests and rivers.

Since independence, it has twice been elected to the [[UN Security Council]]. Bangladeshi diplomat [[Humayun Rashid Choudhury]] served as [[President of the United Nations General Assembly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/president/bios/bio41.shtml|title=UN General Assembly - President of the 62nd Session - Humayun Rasheed Choudhury (Bangladesh)|work=un.org|accessdate=9 December 2015}}</ref>

During the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, Bangladesh contributed 2,300 troops to the US-led multinational coalition for the [[liberation of Kuwait]]. It has since become the world's largest contributor of [[UN peacekeeping]] forces, providing 113,000 personnel to 54 UN missions in the Middle East, the Balkans, Africa and the Caribbean, {{As of|2014|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afd.gov.bd/index.php/un-peacekeeping/bangladesh-in-un-mission|title=Bangladesh in UN Mission|author=Armed Forces Division|publisher=afd.gov.bd}}</ref> Bangladeshi aid agencies work in many developing countries worldwide.

Bangladeshi foreign policy also relies on the country's Islamic heritage, being an [[Organization of the Islamic Conference|OIC member]] and the world's third largest Muslim-majority country, and enjoys fraternal relations with many nations in the [[Muslim world]]. It is a founding member of the [[Developing 8]], along with [[Turkey]], [[Malaysia]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Nigeria]], Pakistan and [[Indonesia]].<ref name="countrystudies.us"/>

Strategically important in South Asia and the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh is classified as a [[middle power]]. It has diverse political, economic and military partnerships in the region.<ref name="countrystudies.us"/> It has played a leading role in organizing regional engagement and development cooperation. The [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] ([[SAARC]]) was founded in [[Dhaka]] in 1985. Three Bangladeshis have since served as its [[Secretary General]]. The Bangladeshi capital hosts the headquarters of the [[Bay of Bengal Initiative]] ([[BIMSTEC]]). The country is part of the [[Bangladesh–China–India–Myanmar Forum for Regional Cooperation]]. It has prioritized relations with [[ASEAN]] members in Southeast Asia. It is a member of the [[Indian Ocean Rim Association]].

Bangladesh's most important bilateral relations are with the two regional powers [[India]] and China. The [[Bangladesh-India relations|relationship with India]] is bound by shared ideals of democracy, cultural heritage and the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|1971 Liberation War]], in which [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian military]] and diplomatic support was crucial in defeating Pakistani forces on Bangladeshi territory. In the early years of Bangladesh's independence, Dhaka and Delhi enjoyed a strong alliance. However, when [[Military coups in Bangladesh|military coups]] began in Bangladesh during the late 1970s, there was increasing distance between the two neighbors. Differences emerged over [[sharing the water of the Ganges]]. Bangladesh developed [[Bangladesh-China relations|very warm relations]] with the People's Republic of China in the 1980s. Defense cooperation rapidly increased as the Bangladeshi military became one of the largest buyers of Chinese defense equipment, given their relative cost-effective attractiveness for the Bangladeshi defence budget.<ref>[http://archive.dhakatribune.com/foreign-affairs/2014/mar/18/china-biggest-arms-supplier-bangladesh China biggest arms supplier to Bangladesh | Dhaka Tribune<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> China has supplied Bangladesh with [[missile]]s and [[frigate]]s. China is also one of Bangladesh's largest trade partners. In more recent years, India has sought to revive relations with Bangladesh through a strategic partnership focused on counter-terrorism, aid for infrastructure development and promoting regional economic integration. Bangladesh and India are the largest trading partners among SAARC nations. The Indian and Bangladeshi armed forces maintain robust strategic engagement. [[Bangladesh-Pakistan relations|Relations with Pakistan]] have been affected by issues related to the [[Bengali genocide|1971 genocide]] and terrorism. Bangladesh enjoys strong ties with regional neighbors [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[Maldives]].

Bangladesh's relations with neighboring [[Myanmar]] are relatively warm. Myanmar was one of the first countries to recognize Bangladesh's independence. Relations were in a brief deadlock due to a naval standoff in 2008 over disputed maritime territory.<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2008/11/20081194956933121.html Bangladesh-Myanmar in standoff - Al Jazeera English<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2012, the two countries resolved their maritime boundary disputes at the [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]].<ref>[http://www.internationallawobserver.eu/2012/03/15/judgment-in-bangladesh-myanmar-maritime-boundary-dispute/ Judgment in Bangladesh-Myanmar Maritime Boundary Dispute | International Law Observer | A blog dedicated to reports, commentary and the discussion of topical issues of interna...<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The relationship with Myanmar is complicated by the persecution of the [[Rohingya people]] in [[Rakhine State]].

Divisions are subdivided into districts (''zila''). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into ''upazila'' (subdistricts) or ''thana''. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several ''[[Union Councils of Bangladesh|unions]]'', with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into ''mahallas''.

There are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held for each union (or ward), electing a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.<ref>''Local Government Act'', No. 20, 1997</ref>

===IT Outsourcing===
Bangladesh has a large number of trained IT professionals. But as the majority of the businesses have not become large enough and on the other hand due to negligence from the part of business owners to understand the benefits of using software and technology in businesses the local demand for these highly skilled professionals has been low. As a result, the IT industry in Bangladesh has turned its focus on exporting software and IT services. Currently it is in 26th position of global IT outsourcing destination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/bangladesh-26th-best-destination-for-it-outsourcing-42306 |title=Bangladesh Best Destination for IT outsourcing |publisher=The Daily Star |date=8 March 2015 }}</ref> The primary reason behind this is Bangladeshi IT companies are providing high quality services at a much lower cost than its competitors. It is currently estimated that the volume of IT outsourcing is doubling every year in Bangladesh. Several Bangladeshi IT companies has been successful in the global enterprise software market. Bangladeshi Government is envisioning IT sector as the second largest export sector after Garments in the coming years.

And despite their dwindling numbers, Hindus are the second-largest religious community after the Muslims in [[Dhaka]].

[[Buddhism in Bangladesh|Buddhism]] is the third largest religion, at 0.6%. Bangladeshi Buddhists are largely concentrated among [[Ethnic groups in Bangladesh|ethnic groups]] in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]], particularly the [[Chakma people|Chakma]], [[Marma people|Marma]] and [[Tanchangya people|Tanchangya]] peoples; while coastal Chittagong is home to the large number of [[Bengali Buddhist]]s.

===Education===
{{Main article|Education in Bangladesh}}
Bangladesh has a low [[literacy rate]], estimated at 66.5% for males and 63.1% for females in 2014.<ref name=CIA /> The educational system in Bangladesh is three-tiered and highly subsidized. The government operates many schools in the primary, secondary, and higher secondary levels. It subsidises parts of the funding for many private schools. In the tertiary education sector, the government funds more than 15 state universities through the [[University Grants Commission of Bangladesh|University Grants Commission]].

The education system is divided into five levels: Primary (from grades 1 to 5), Junior Secondary (from grades 6 to 8), Secondary (from grades 9 to 10), Higher Secondary (from grades 11 to 12) and tertiary.<ref name=CompEd>{{cite book|author=T.

Earlier, students who pass this examination proceed to four years secondary or matriculation training, which culminate in a Secondary School Certificate (SSC) Examination.<ref name=CompEd />
[[File:Students of Bangladesh Bank Colony High School performed in Rajat Jayanti (01).jpg|thumb|Bangladeshi schoolchildren performing on a stage]]
Primary Education Closing (PEC) passed examinees proceed to three years Junior Secondary, which culminate in a [[Junior School Certificate]] (JSC) Examination. Students who pass this examination proceed to two years secondary or matriculation training, which culminate in a Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination. Students who pass this examination proceed to two years of Higher Secondary or intermediate training, which culminate in a [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (HSC) examination.<ref name=CompEd />

Education is mainly offered in Bengali, but English is commonly taught and used. A large number of Muslim families send their children to attend part-time courses or even to pursue full-time religious education, which is imparted in Bengali and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in madrasahs.<ref name=CompEd />

Bangladesh conforms fully to the [[Education For All]] (EFA) objectives, the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG) and international declarations.<!-- Who set the EFA and MDG declarations? --> Article 17 of the [[Bangladesh Constitution]] provides that all children between the ages of six and ten years receive a basic education free of charge.

[[Universities in Bangladesh]] are mainly categorized into three types: public (government owned and subsidized), private (private sector owned universities) and international (operated and funded by international organizations). Bangladesh has 34 public, 64 private and two international [[List of universities in Bangladesh|universities]]. [[Bangladesh National University]] has the largest enrollment among them and [[University of Dhaka]] (established 1921) is the oldest. [[Islamic University of Technology]], commonly known as IUT, is a subsidiary organ of the Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation ([[OIC]]), representing 57 member countries from Asia, Africa, Europe and South America. [[Asian University for Women]] in Chittagong is the preeminent liberal arts university for women in South Asia, representing 14 countries from Asia.

===Health===
{{Main article|Health in Bangladesh}}

Health and education levels remain relatively low, although they have improved recently as poverty levels have decreased. In the rural areas, village doctors with little or no formal training constitute 62% of the healthcare providers practicing modern medicine and the formally trained providers are occupying a mere 4% of the total health workforce. A survey conducted by Future Health Systems revealed significant deficiencies in treatment practices of village doctors, with a wide prevalence of harmful and inappropriate drug prescriptions.<ref name="FHS Research Brief 2">{{cite journal|last=Bhuiya|first=Abbas|title=Costs of utilizing healthcare services in Chakaria, a rural area in Bangladesh|journal=FHS Research Brief|date=June 2009|issue=2|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/fhs-bangladesh-research-brief-2-costs-of-utilizing-healthcar.html}}</ref> There are market incentives for accessing health care through informal providers and it is important to understand these markets in order to facilitate collaboration across actors and institutions in order to provide incentives for better performance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bloom |first1=G |last2=Standing |first2=H. |last3=Lucas |first3=H |last4=Bhuiya |first4=A |last5=Oladepo |first5=O |last6=Peters |first6=DH |display-authors=5 |date=2011 |title=Making Health Markets Work Better for Poor People: The Case of Informal Providers|journal=Health Policy and Planning |volume=26 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=i45&nbsp;– i52 |url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/making-health-markets-work-better-for-poor-people-the-case-o.html |accessdate=26 May 2012 |doi=10.1093/heapol/czr025 |pmid=21729917}}</ref>

A 2007 study of 1000 households in rural Bangladesh found that direct costs (payment to formal and informal health care providers) and indirect costs (loss of earnings associated with workdays lost because of illness) associated with illness were important deterrents to accessing health care from qualified healthcare providers.<ref name="FHS Research Brief 2" /> A community survey with 6183 individuals in rural Bangladesh found a clear gender difference in treatment-seeking behaviour, with women less likely to seek treatment compared to men.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bhuiya|first=Abbas|title=Health Seeking Behaviour In Chakaria|journal=FHS Research Brief|date=September 2008|issue=1|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/fhs-bangladesh-research-brief-1-health-seeking-behaviour-in.html}}</ref> The use of skilled birth attendants, however, has risen between 2005 and 2007 by women in all wealth quintiles except the highest quintile.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bhuiya|first=Abbas|title=Three methods to monitor utilization of healthcare services by the poor|journal=Int J for Equity in Health|year=2009|volume=8|page=29|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/three-methods-to-monitor-utilization-of-healthcare-services.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|doi=10.1186/1475-9276-8-29|display-authors=etal}}</ref> A pilot community empowerment tool, called a health watch, was successfully developed and implemented in south-eastern Bangladesh in order to improve uptake and monitoring of public health services.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Aziz|first=Rumesa|title=A community health watch to establish accountability and improve performance of the health system|journal=FHS Research Brief|date=November 2009|issue=3|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/fhs-bangladesh-research-brief-3-a-community-health-watch-to.html}}</ref>

Pre-Islamic Bengali architecture reached its pinnacle during the [[Pala Empire]], when the Pala School of Sculptural Art established grand structures such as the [[Somapura Mahavihara]]. [[Islamic architecture]] began developing under the [[Bengal Sultanate]], when local terracotta styles influenced medieval mosque construction. The [[Adina Mosque]] of undivided Bengal was the largest mosque built in the Indian subcontinent.

The [[Sixty Dome Mosque]] was the largest medieval mosque built in Bangladesh, and is a fine example of Turkic-Bengali architecture. The [[Mughal architecture|Mughal style]] replaced indigenous architecture when Bengal became a province of the [[Mughal Empire]] and influenced the development of urban housing. The [[Kantajew Temple]] and [[Dhakeshwari Temple]] are excellent examples of late medieval [[Hindu temple architecture]]. [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]], based on Indo-Islamic styles, flourished during the [[British Raj|British period]]. The [[zamindar]] gentry in Bangladesh built numerous Indo-Saracenic palaces and country mansions, such as the [[Ahsan Manzil]], [[Tajhat Palace]], [[Uttara Gonobhaban|Dighapatia Palace]], [[Puthia Rajbari]] and [[Natore Rajbari]].

Bengali [[vernacular architecture]] is noted for pioneering the [[bungalow]]. Bangladeshi villages consist of [[thatch]]ed roofed houses made of natural materials like [[mud]], [[straw]], wood and [[bamboo]]. In modern times, village bungalows are increasingly made of [[tin]].

[[Muzharul Islam]] was the pioneer of Bangladeshi modern architecture. His varied works set the course of modern architectural practice in the country. Islam brought leading global architects, including [[Louis Kahn]], [[Richard Neutra]], [[Stanley Tigerman]], [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], [[Robert Boughey]] and [[Konstantinos Apostolos Doxiadis|Konstantinos Doxiadis]], to work in erstwhile [[East Pakistan]]. Louis Kahn was chosen to design the National Parliament Complex in [[Sher-e-Bangla Nagar]]. Kahn's monumental designs, combining regional red brick aesthetics, his own concrete and marble [[brutalism]] and the use of lakes to represent Bengali geography, are regarded as one of the masterpieces of the 20th century. In more recent times, award winning architects like [[Rafiq Azam]] have set the course of contemporary architecture by adopting influences from Islam and Kahns' works.

Bangladesh has a rich heritage of ancient Indian and Islamic art, including in painting, sculpture and architecture. [[Terracotta]] works are a distinctive feature of Bengali art. Bengal also influenced the art of [[Chinese art|China]], [[Japanese art|Japan]], South East Asia and [[Tibetan art|Tibet]]. The Pala-Sena School is regarded as the high point of ancient Bengali art. Islamic medieval art was highly influenced by [[Persian art]], particularly in architecture, gardening and [[Persian miniature|miniature painting]]. The [[Mughal Emperor]]s patronized the weaving of artistic Bengali silk and [[muslin]] textiles, including the famed [[Jamdani]] muslin. The [[Nawabs of Bengal]] were noted for patronizing [[ivory]] craftsmanship.

Modern [[Bangladeshi art]] began with the works of [[Zainul Abedin]], a renowned painter. Other notable painters include [[SM Sultan]], [[Mohammad Kibria]], [[Shahabuddin Ahmed (artist)|Shahabuddin Ahmed]], [[Quamrul Hassan]], [[Qayyum Chowdhury]] and [[Kanak Chanpa Chakma]]. Notably early modern sculptors included [[Novera Ahmed]] and [[Nitun Kundu]]. The country has a thriving [[contemporary art]] scene which has received international acclaim. The [[Dhaka Art Summit]] is a biannual event showcasing Bangladeshi works to an international audience.

[[Bangladeshi martial arts]] evolved in villages where [[zamindar]]s employed large private armies to protect their landholdings. The [[Lathi khela]] and [[Boli Khela]] are two major forms of Bengali martial arts.

[[File:Kantha (Quilt) LACMA AC1994.131.1.jpg|thumb|left|19th century [[Nakshi kantha]]]]
The [[Nakshi Kantha]] is a centuries-old [[embroidery]] tradition for [[quilt]]s, said to be indigenous to eastern Bengal (Bangladesh). The sari is the national dress for Bangladeshi woman. Mughal Dhaka was renowned for producing the finest [[muslin]] [[sari]]s, including the famed [[Dhakai]] and [[Jamdani]], the weaving of which is listed by [[UNESCO]] as one of the masterpieces of humanity's intangible cultural heritage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Traditional art of Jamdani weaving - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/traditional-art-of-jamdani-weaving-00879|website=www.unesco.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref> Bangladesh also produces the [[Rajshahi silk]]. The [[shalwar kameez]] is also widely worn by Bangladeshi women.  In urban areas some women can be also seen in western clothing. The [[kurta]] and [[sherwani]] are the national dresses of Bangladeshi men. The [[lungi]] and [[dhoti]] is worn by Bengali men in informal settings. The handloom industry supplies of 60-65% of clothing demand.<ref>Ahmad, Shamsuddin (2012). "Textiles". In Islam, Sirajul; Jamal, Ahmed A. Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh (Second ed.). Asiatic Society of Bangladesh.</ref> Aside from ethnic wear, domestically [[tailored]] [[suit (clothing)|suits]] and [[neckties]] are usually worn by men in the country, and it is customary in offices, schools and social events.

The Bengali ethnic [[fashion industry]] has flourished well in the changing environment of the fashion world. The retailer [[Aarong]] is one of the most successful ethnic wear brands in South Asia. The development of the [[Bangladesh textile industry]], which supplies leading international brands, has promoted the production and retail of modern Western attire locally, with the country now having a number of expanding local brands like Westecs and Yellow. Bangladesh is the world's second largest garments exporter.

Among Bangladesh's fashion designers, [[Bibi Russell]] has achieved international acclaim for her "Fashion for Development" shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture-and-development.info/issues/morebibi.htm|title=more Bibi Russell|publisher=}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{Main article|Bengali cuisine|Bangladeshi cuisine}}
[[File:Bangladeshi cuisine.png|thumb|300px|A variety of Bangladeshi foods— smoked ''[[ilish]]'' with mustard-seeds, ''[[biryani]]'' and ''[[pitha]]''s]]
[[White rice]] is the staple of Bangladeshi cuisine, along with many vegetables and [[lentil]]s. Rice preparations also include Bengali [[biryani]]s, [[pilaf|pulaos]], and [[khichuri]]s. [[Mustard (condiment)|Mustard]] sauce, [[ghee]], [[sunflower oil]] and fruit [[chutney]]s are widely used in Bangladeshi cooking. Fish is the main source of protein in Bengali cuisine. The [[Hilsa]] is the national fish and immensely popular across Bangladesh. Other fishes eaten include [[rohu]], [[butterfish]], catfish, [[tilapia]] and [[barramundi]]. [[Fish egg]]s are a gourmet delicacy. Seafood holds an important place in Bengali cuisine, especially [[lobster]]s, [[shrimp]]s and [[dried fish]]. Meat consumption includes chicken, beef, [[mutton]], [[venison]], [[duck]] and [[squab (food)|squab]]. In Chittagong, ''Mezban'' feasts are a popular tradition featuring the serving of hot beef [[curry]]. In Sylhet, the ''[[shatkora]]'' lemons are used to marinate dishes. In the tribal Hill Tracts, bamboo shoot cooking is prevalent. Bangladesh has a vast spread of desserts, including distinctive [[sweets]] like ''[[Rasgulla|Rôshogolla]]'', ''Rôshomalai'', ''[[Chomchom]]'', ''Mishti Doi'' and ''Kalojaam''. [[Pitha]]s are traditional boiled desserts made with rice or fruits. [[Halwa]] is served during religious festivities. [[Naan]], [[paratha]], [[luchi]] and [[bakarkhani]] are the main local breads. [[Black tea]] is offered to guests as a gesture of welcome. [[Kebab]]s are widely popular across Bangladesh, particularly [[seekh kebab]]s, [[chicken tikka]] and [[shashlik]]s.

Bangladesh shares its culinary heritage with the neighboring Indian state of [[West Bengal]]. The two regions have several differences, however. In Muslim-majority Bangladesh, meat consumption is greater; whereas in Hindu-majority West Bengal, vegetarianism is more prevalent. The Bangladeshi diaspora dominates the South Asian restaurant industry in many Western countries, particularly in the United Kingdom.

===Festivals===
{{Main article|Public holidays in Bangladesh}}
[[File:Mangal Shobhajatra in Dhaka.jpg|thumb|270px|The annual [[Bengali New Year]] parade.]]
''[[Pohela Boishakh]]'', the Bengali new year, is the major festival of [[Culture of Bengal|Bengali culture]] and sees widespread festivities. Of the major holidays celebrated in Bangladesh, only Pohela Boishakh comes without any preexisting expectations (specific religious identity, culture of gift-giving, etc.). Unlike holidays like Eid al-Fitr, where dressing up in lavish clothes has become a norm, or Christmas where exchanging gifts has become an integral part of the holiday, Pohela Boishakh is really about celebrating the simpler, rural roots of the Bengal. As a result, more people can participate in the festivities together without the burden of having to reveal one's class, religion, or financial capacity. Other cultural festivals include [[Nabanna|Nabonno]], and Poush Parbon both of which are Bengali harvest festivals.

The Muslim festivals of [[Eid al-Fitr]], [[Eid al-Adha]], [[Milad un Nabi]], [[Muharram]], [[Chand Raat]], [[Barat Night|Shab-e-Barat]]; the Hindu festivals of [[Durga Puja]], [[Janmashtami]] and [[Rath Yatra]]; the Buddhist festival of [[Vesak|Buddha Purnima]], which marks the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]], and Christian festival of Christmas are [[Public holidays in Bangladesh|national holidays]] in Bangladesh and see the most widespread celebrations in the country.

Alongside there are national days like the remembrance of 21 February 1952 [[Language Movement Day]] ([[International Mother Language Day]]), [[Independence Day (Bangladesh)|Independence Day]] and
[[Victory day of Bangladesh|Victory Day]]. On Language Movement Day, people congregate at the [[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]] in Dhaka to remember the national heroes of the [[Bengali Language Movement]], and at the [[Jatiyo Smriti Soudho]] on Independence Day and Victory Day to remember the national heroes of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. These occasions are observed with public ceremonies, parades, rallies by citizens, political speeches, fairs, concerts, and various other public and private events celebrating the history and traditions of Bangladesh. TV and radio stations broadcast special programs and patriotic songs. And many schools and colleges organise fairs, festivals, and concerts in which citizens from all levels of society can participate.

===Sports===
{{Main article|Sports in Bangladesh}}
[[File:Bangladesh Team Returning to Dressing Room.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Bangladesh cricket team]] at the [[Mirpur Stadium]]]]
[[Cricket]] is one of the most popular sports in Bangladesh, followed by [[association football|football]]. The [[Bangladesh national cricket team|national cricket team]] participated in their first [[Cricket World Cup]] in 1999, and the following year was granted elite [[Test cricket]] status. But they have struggled to date, recording only ten Test match victories: eight against [[Zimbabwe]] with five in 2005 and three in 2014, the other two came in a 2-0 series victory over the [[West Indies]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/8160263.stm |title=Bangladesh secure series victory|publisher=BBC News |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=3 July 2010}}</ref>

Later in 2010, they beat New Zealand for the first time. In late 2012, they won a five-match home ODI series 3-2 against a full-strength West Indies National team. In 2011, Bangladesh successfully co-hosted the [[ICC Cricket World Cup 2011]] with India and [[Sri Lanka]]. In 2012, the country hosted the [[Asia Cup]]. The team beat India and Sri Lanka but failed to keep the reputation in the final game against Pakistan. However, it was the first time Bangladesh had advanced to the final of any top-class international cricket tournament. They participated at the [[2010 Asian Games]] in Guangzhou, defeating Afghanistan to claim their Gold Medal in the first ever cricket tournament held in the Asian Games. Bangladeshi cricketer [[Sakib Al Hasan]] is no.1 on the [[International Cricket Council|ICC's]] [[all-rounder]] rankings in all three formats of the cricket.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/cricket-world-cup/worlds-best-allrounder-shakib-al-hasan-to-kickstart-bangladeshs-cricket-world-cup-campaign-at-manuka-20150215-13f7i5.html|title = World's best all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan to kick-start Bangladesh's Cricket World Cup campaign at Manuka|last = Polkinghorne|first = David |date = 15 February 2015|work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref>

In another achievement, [[Margarita Mamun]], a Russian [[rhythmic gymnast]] of Bangladeshi origin,became world champion in 2013 and 2014.

===Media and cinema===
{{Main article|Media of Bangladesh|Cinema of Bangladesh}}
The Bangladeshi press is diverse, outspoken and privately owned. Over 200 newspapers are published in the country. [[Bangladesh Betar]] is the state-run radio service.<ref>{{cite news |title=Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra's Rashidul Hossain passes away |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2015/12/22/swadhin-bangla-betar-kendras-rashidul-hossain-passes-away |newspaper=bdnews24.com |accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref> The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] operates the popular [[BBC Bangla]] news and current affairs service. Bengali broadcasts from [[Voice of America]] are also very popular. [[Bangladesh Television]] (BTV) is the state-owned television network. There more than 20 privately owned television networks, including several [[news channel]]s. [[Freedom of the media]] remains a major concern, due to government attempts at censorship and harassment of journalists.

The [[cinema of Bangladesh]] dates back to 1898, when films began screening at the Crown Theatre in Dacca. The first bioscope in the subcontinent was established in Dacca that year. The [[Dhaka Nawab Family]] patronized the production of several [[silent film]]s in the 1920s and 30s. In 1931, the East Bengal Cinematograph Society released the first full-length feature film in Bangladesh, titled the ''Last Kiss''. The first feature film in [[East Pakistan]], ''[[Mukh O Mukhosh]]'', was released in 1956. During the 1960s, 25-30 films were produced annually in Dacca. By the 2000s, Bangladesh produced 80-100 films a year. While the Bangladeshi film industry has achieved limited commercial success; the country has produced notable independent filmmakers. [[Zahir Raihan]] was a prominent documentary-maker who was assassinated in 1971. The late [[Tareque Masud]] is regarded as one of Bangladesh's outstanding directors due to his numerous productions on historical and social issues. Masud was honored by [[FIPRESCI]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2002 for his film ''[[Matir Moina|The Clay Bird]]''. [[Tanvir Mokammel]], [[Mostofa Sarwar Farooki]], [[Humayun Ahmed]], [[Alamgir Kabir (film maker)|Alamgir Kabir]], [[Chashi Nazrul Islam]] are some of the prominent directors of [[Cinema of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi cinema]].

===Rickshaws===
{{See also|Rickshaw art in Bangladesh}}
[[File:Rickshaws everywhere.jpg|thumb|right|Bangladeshi rickshaws.]]
[[Cycle rickshaw]]s are the most popular form of public transport in Bangladesh. [[Dhaka]], the nation's biggest city, is nicknamed the ''Rickshaw Capital of the World''.<ref name="bbc.com">{{cite news |title=Painting Bangladesh's colourful rickshaws |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30854038 |work=BBC News}}</ref> Rickshaws also ply the streets of other major cities, as well as the countryside.
Bangladeshi rickshaws are decorated with colorful posters and boards, often depicting movie stars, national monuments or religious icons. [[Rickshaw art]] is considered a form of [[neo-romanticism]]. This unique trend started in [[Rajshahi]] and [[Dhaka]] in the 1950s. Each region of Bangladesh has a distinct style of rickshaw art. For example, rickshaw art in Chittagong and Comilla are dominated by floral scenery and Arabic texts.
Auto-rickshaws are widely seen in urban centers. Cycle-driven carts are found in many parts of the country. Bangladeshi rickshaw art has received international fame, and has been called "people's art".

Rickshaw driving provides employment for many poor Bangladeshis coming from rural areas.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rahman  |first=Urmi |date=2014 |title=Bangladesh - Culture Smart!: The Essential Guide to Customs & Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HelAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT135 |publisher=Kuperard |pages=135– |isbn=978-1-85733-696-2}}</ref>

The [[Varendra Research Museum]] is the oldest museum in Bangladesh. It houses important collections from both the pre-Islamic and Islamic periods, including the sculptures of the Pala-Sena School of Art and the Indus Valley Civilization; as well as Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian manuscripts and inscriptions. The [[Ahsan Manzil]], the former residence of the Nawab of Dhaka, is a national museum housing collections from the British Raj. It was the site of the founding conference of the All India Muslim League and hosted many British Viceroys in Dhaka.

In ancient times, manuscripts were written on palm leaves, tree barks, parchment vellum and terracotta plates and preserved at monasteries known as ''[[vihara]]s''. The [[Hussain Shahi dynasty]] established royal libraries during the [[Bengal Sultanate]]. Libraries were established in each district of Bengal by the [[zamindar]] gentry during the [[Bengal Renaissance]] in the 19th-century. The trend of establishing libraries continued until the beginning of World War II. In 1854, four major public libraries were opened, including the Bogra Woodburn Library, the Rangpur Public Library, the Jessore Institute Public Library and the Barisal Public Library.

The [[Northbrook Hall|Northbrook Hall Public Library]] was established in Dacca in 1882 in honour of [[Lord Northbrook]], the Governor General.
