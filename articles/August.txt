'''August''' is the eighth [[month]] of the [[year]] (between [[July]] and [[September]]) in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s and the fifth month to have the length of 31 days.<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/42820/August August]." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2008. [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]. 23 September 2008.</ref>
 
In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], August is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. In many European countries, August is the [[Annual leave|holiday]] month for most workers.

Certain [[meteor shower]]s take place in August. The [[Kappa Cygnids]] take place in August with the dates varying each year, the [[Alpha Capricornids]] meteor shower takes place as early as July 10 and ends at around August 10, and the  [[Southern Delta Aquariids]] take place from mid-July to mid-August with the peak usually around July 28–29. The [[Perseids]], a major meteor shower, typically takes place between July 17 - August 24, with the days of the peak varying yearly.

The star cluster of [[Messier 30]] is best observed around August.

This month was originally named ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]], because it was the sixth month in the original ten-month [[Roman calendar]] under [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]] in 753 BC, when [[March]] was the first month of the year. About 700&nbsp;BC it became the eighth month when [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the year before March by King [[Numa Pompilius]], who also gave it 29 days. [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in 45 BC giving it its modern length of 31 days. In 8 BC it was [[Augustus#Month of August|renamed]] in honor of [[Augustus]] (despite common belief, he did not take a day from February; see the [[Julian calendar#Sacrobosco's theory on month lengths|debunked theory on month lengths]]). According to a [[Senatus consultum]] quoted by [[Macrobius]], he chose this month because it was the time of several of his great triumphs, including the conquest of Egypt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0063:id=calendarium-cn|title=Year of Julius Caesar, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities (1890), William Smith, LLD, William Wayte, G. E. Marindin, Ed.|publisher=}}</ref>

In ancient Rome, [[Supplicia canum]] was held on August 3, [[Lychnapsia]] was held on August 12, [[Nemoralia]] was held from August 13–15 (or on the full moon of August), [[Tiberinalia]] and [[Portunes|Portumnalia]] were held on August 17, [[Consualia|Consuales Ludi]] was held on August 18, [[Vinalia|Vinalia rustica]] was held on August 19, [[Vulcan (mythology)#Vulcanalia|Vulcanalia]] was held on August 23, [[Opiconsivia]] was held on August 25, and [[Volturnalia]] was held on August 27. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.

August is the month with highest birth rate in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/32728-baby-month-is-almost-here-.html|title=In Which Month Are the Most Babies Born?|work=LiveScience.com}}</ref>
