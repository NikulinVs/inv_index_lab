'''André René Roussimoff''' (May 19, 1946 – January 27, 1993), best known as '''André the Giant''', was a French [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and [[actor]].<ref name="OWO">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/a/andre-the-giant.html|title=André the Giant Profile|accessdate=September 22, 2008|website=Online World of Wrestling|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921232831/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/a/andre-the-giant.html|archivedate=September 21, 2008|deadurl=no}}</ref>

He most famously feuded with [[Hulk Hogan]], culminating at [[WrestleMania III]], and his best-remembered film role was that of Fezzik, the giant in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''.<ref name="official"/> His size was a result of [[gigantism]] caused by excess growth hormone, which later resulted in [[acromegaly]]. It also led to him being called "The [[Eighth Wonder of the World]]".<ref name="wwearchive">{{cite web|title=Andre the Giant: Bio |website=WWE |url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/andrethegiant|accessdate=April 2, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501202657/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/andrethegiant/bio/|archivedate=May 1, 2009|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name=AndreWebsite>{{cite web|url=http://www.andrethegiant.com/|title=André the Giant official website |accessdate=July 8, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704022027/http://www.andrethegiant.com/|archivedate=July 4, 2007|deadurl=no}}</ref>

In the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as [[WWE]]), André was a [[List of WWE World Champions|one-time]] [[WWE World Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] and a [[List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)|one-time]] [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champion]]. In 1993, André was the inaugural inductee into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]].<ref name="wwebio">{{cite web |title=Andre the Giant: Bio|website=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/andrethegiant |accessdate=April 2, 2011}}</ref><ref name=Legends>{{cite book |title=WWE Legends |last=Solomon |first=Brian |pages=68–71 |publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=0-7434-9033-9}}</ref>

== Early life ==
André Roussimoff was born in [[Coulommiers, Seine-et-Marne|Coulommiers]], France to Boris and Mariann Rousimoff, a couple of [[Bulgaria]]n and [[Poland|Polish]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Laprade |first1=Pat |last2=Hebert |first2=Bertrand |title=Mad Dogs, Midgets and Screw Jobs: The Untold Story of How Montreal Shaped the World of Wrestling |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey8bluWM_m4C&pg=PA1910 |date=February 1, 2013 |publisher=ECW Press |isbn=978-1-77090-296-1 |page=1910}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hornbaker |first=Tim |title=Legends of Pro Wrestling: 150 Years of Headlocks, Body Slams, and Piledrivers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZ_C66kg8uAC&pg=PT413 |date=July 3, 2012 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Company, Inc. |isbn=978-1-61321-314-8 |page=413}}</ref> His nickname growing up was "Dédé". As a child, he displayed symptoms of his [[gigantism]] very early, reaching a height of {{convert|6|ft|3|in|cm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and a weight of {{convert|208|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} by the age of 12. Playwright [[Samuel Beckett]], a neighbor who later won the Nobel Prize for Literature,<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420001825/http://historicalmeetups.com/post/1524567373/samuel-beckett-playwright-novelist-and-nobel |archivedate=April 20, 2012 |url=http://historicalmeetups.com/post/1524567373/samuel-beckett-playwright-novelist-and-nobel |title=Samuel Beckett Playwright, novelist, and Nobel |website=Historical Meet-Ups |date= |accessdate=June 8, 2012}}</ref> bought some land in 1953 near a hamlet around {{convert|40|mi|km|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} northeast of Paris. He built a cottage for himself with the help of André's father Boris Rousimoff. When Beckett found out that Rousimoff was having trouble getting his son to school, Beckett offered to drive André to school in his truck, as he did not fit on the bus. When André recounted the drives with Beckett, he revealed that they rarely talked about anything other than cricket.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themarysue.com/samuel-beckett-andre-the-giant/ |title=Samuel Beckett Used to Drive André the Giant to School, All They Talked About Was Cricket |date=July 11, 2011 |accessdate=January 9, 2015 |website=The Mary Sue}}</ref>

Roussimoff was a good student, particularly in [[mathematics]], but he dropped out after the eighth grade since he did not think having a high school education was necessary for a farm laborer. He spent years working on his father's farm, where, according to his brother, Jacques, he could perform the work of three men. He also completed an [[apprenticeship]] in woodworking, and next worked in a factory that manufactured engines for [[baler|hay balers]]. None of these occupations, however, brought him any satisfaction.<ref name=AEbio>{{cite episode |title=André the Giant |series=Biography |network=[[A&E (TV channel)|A&E Network]] |airdate=January 13, 1998}}</ref>

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career ===
At age 17, Roussimoff moved to Paris and was taught [[professional wrestling]] by a local promoter who recognized the earning potential of Roussimoff's size. He trained at night and worked as a mover during the day to pay living expenses.<ref name=AEbio/> Roussimoff was billed as "Géant Ferré", a name based on the French folk hero [[:fr:Grand Ferré|Grand Ferré]],{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=4}} and began wrestling in Paris and nearby areas. Canadian promoter and wrestler Frank Valois met Roussimoff in 1966, becoming his business manager and adviser. Roussimoff began making a name for himself wrestling in the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=4}}{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=7}}<ref name=AEbio/>

He made his Japanese debut in 1970, billed as "Monster Roussimoff", wrestling for the [[International Wrestling Enterprise]]. Wrestling as both a singles and tag team competitor, he quickly was made the company's tag team champion alongside Michael Nador.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=7}}<ref name=IWAtagchamp>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/iwe/iwe-t.html |title=IWA World Tag Team Title |website=Wrestling Titles |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref> During his time in Japan, doctors first informed Roussimoff that he suffered from [[acromegaly]].{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=7}}<ref name=AEbio/>

Roussimoff next moved to [[Montréal]], Canada, where he became an immediate success, regularly selling out the [[Montreal Forum]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Pain and Passion |last=McCoy |first=Heath |page=96 |publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2007 |isbn=978-1-55022-787-1}}</ref> However, promoters eventually ran out of plausible opponents for him and, as the novelty of his size wore off, the gate receipts dwindled.<ref name=AEbio/> Roussimoff was defeated by [[Adnan Al-Kaissie]] in [[Baghdad]] in 1971,<ref>''The Sheik of Baghdad: Tales of Celebrity and Terror from Pro Wrestling's General Adnan'' Triumph Books 2005</ref> and wrestled numerous times in 1972 for Verne Gagne's [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) as a special attraction until Valois appealed to [[Vince McMahon, Sr.|Vince McMahon Sr.]], founder of the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF), for advice.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=9}} McMahon suggested several changes. He felt Roussimoff should be portrayed as a large, immovable monster, and to enhance the perception of his size, McMahon discouraged Roussimoff from performing maneuvers such as [[dropkick]]s (although he was capable of performing such agile maneuvers before his health deteriorated in later life). He also began billing Roussimoff as "André the Giant" and set up a travel-intensive schedule, loaning him to wrestling associations around the world,<ref name=Legends/><ref>{{cite book |title=Dusty: Reflections of an American Dream |last=Rhodes |first=Dusty |authorlink=Dusty Rhodes (wrestler) |pages=95–96 |publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2005 |isbn=978-1-58261-907-1}}</ref>{{sfnp|Assael|Mooneyham|2002|p=71}} to keep him from becoming overexposed in any area.<ref name=AEbio/> Promoters had to guarantee André a certain amount of money as well as pay McMahon's WWWF booking fee.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=12–13}}

=== World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation ===

==== Undefeated streak (1973–1987) ====
On March 26, 1973, André debuted in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (later World Wrestling Federation) as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]], defeating [[Buddy Wolfe]] in New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref name="official"/><ref name=Legends/><ref name="WWWF73">{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/73.htm |title=WWWF @ New York City, NY – Madison Square Garden – March 26, 1973 |website=The History of WWE |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}</ref>

André was one of professional wrestling's most beloved "[[BabyFace (professional wrestling)|babyfaces]]" throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. As such, [[Gorilla Monsoon]] often stated that André had never been defeated for 15 years by pinfall or submission prior to [[WrestleMania III]]; however, André had lost in matches outside of the WWF: a pinfall loss in Mexico to [[Canek (wrestler)|Canek]] in 1984 and a submission loss in Japan to [[Antonio Inoki]] in 1986.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=110}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/inoki.html |title=Antonio Inoki: Career History |website=Puroresu Central |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}</ref> He also had sixty-minute time limit draws with the two other major world champions of the day, [[Harley Race]] and [[Nick Bockwinkel]].

In 1976, André fought professional boxer [[Chuck Wepner]] in an unscripted boxer-versus-wrestler fight. The wild fight was shown via telecast as part of the undercard of the [[Muhammad Ali]] versus Antonio Inoki fight and ended when André threw Wepner over the top rope and outside the ring.

In 1980, he feuded with Hulk Hogan, wrestling him at Shea Stadium's [[Showdown at Shea]] and in Pennsylvania. The feud continued in Japan in 1982 and 1983.

In 1982, Vince McMahon, Sr. sold the World Wide Wrestling Federation to his son, [[Vince McMahon|Vince McMahon, Jr.]].<ref>{{cite book |title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Pro Wrestling |last=Hornbaker |first=Tim |page=193 |publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2007 |isbn=978-1-55022-741-3}}</ref> As McMahon began to expand his newly acquired promotion to the national level, he required his wrestlers to appear exclusively for him. McMahon signed André to these terms in 1984, although he still allowed him to work in Japan for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW).{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=69–70}}

One of André's feuds pitted him against the "Mongolian Giant" [[Killer Khan]]. According to the storyline, Khan had snapped André's ankle during a match on May 2, 1981, in [[Rochester, New York]], by leaping off the top rope and crashing down upon it with his knee-drop.<ref name=MainEvent>{{cite book |title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s |last=Shields |first=Brian |pages=55–58 |publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6}}</ref> In reality, André had broken his ankle getting out of bed the morning before the match.<ref name=AEbio/>{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=48}} The injury and subsequent rehabilitation was worked into the existing André/Khan storyline. After a stay at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, André returned with payback on his mind. The two battled on July 20, 1981, at Madison Square Garden in a match that resulted in a [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|double disqualification]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989 |last=Cawthon |first=Graham |pages=339 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}</ref> Their feud continued as fans filled arenas up and down the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] to witness their matches. On November 14, 1981, at the [[Spectrum (arena)|Philadelphia Spectrum]], André decisively defeated Khan in what was billed as a "Mongolian stretcher match", in which the loser must be taken to the dressing room on a stretcher.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=48–60}} The same type of match was also held in Toronto. In early 1982 the two also fought in a series of matches in Japan with Arnold Skaaland in Andre's corner.

[[File:Andre the Giant.jpg|thumb|André (second from right) feuded with [[Big John Studd]] (left) in the build towards [[WrestleMania I]], and later with [[King Kong Bundy]] (second from left)]]
Another feud involved a man who considered himself to be the "true giant" of wrestling: [[Big John Studd]].<ref name=MainEvent/> Throughout the early to mid-1980s, André and Studd fought all over the world, battling to try to determine who the real giant of wrestling was. In 1984, Studd took the feud to a new level when he and partner [[Ken Patera]] knocked out André during a televised tag team match and proceeded to cut off André's hair.<ref name=MainEvent/> After gaining revenge on Patera, André met Studd in a "[[Professional wrestling throws#Body slam|body slam]] challenge" at the first [[WrestleMania I|WrestleMania]], held March 31, 1985, at Madison Square Garden in New York City.<ref name="Shields2010">{{cite book |first=Brian |last=Shields |title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ktv7Nj2C9QUC&pg=PA150 |date=June 15, 2010 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-4516-0467-2 |pages=150–}}</ref> André slammed Studd to win the match and collect the [[United States dollar|$]]15,000 prize, then proceeded to throw cash to the fans before having the bag taken from him by Studd's manager, [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]].<ref name=WMIfacts>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm1/factsstats/ |title=WrestleMania I Facts/Stats |website=[[WWE]] |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}</ref>

The following year, at [[WrestleMania 2]], on April 7, 1986, André continued to display his dominance by winning a twenty-man [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] which featured top [[National Football League]] stars and wrestlers.<ref name=WM2>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm2/results/ |title=WrestleMania 2 results |website=[[WWE]] |accessdate=February 14, 2011}}</ref> André last eliminated [[Bret Hart]] to win the contest.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=107}}

After WrestleMania 2, André continued his feud with Studd and [[King Kong Bundy]]. Around this time, André requested a leave of absence to tend to his health&mdash;effects from his acromegaly that were beginning to take their toll&mdash;as well as tour Japan. He had also been cast in the film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''. To explain André's absence, a storyline was developed in which Heenan&mdash;suggesting that André was secretly afraid of Studd and Bundy, whom Heenan bragged were unbeatable&mdash;challenged André and a partner of his choosing to wrestle Studd and Bundy in a televised tag team match. When André failed to show, WWF president [[Jack Tunney]] indefinitely suspended him.<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book |title=WWE Encyclopedia |last1=Shields |first1=Brian |last2=Sullivan |first2=Kevin |pages=12–13 |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}</ref> Later in the summer of 1986, upon André's return to the United States, he began wearing a mask and competing as the "Giant Machine" in a stable known as [[The Machines (professional wrestling)|the Machines]]. ([[Blackjack Mulligan|Big Machine]] and [[Bill Eadie|Super Machine]] were the other members.) The WWF's television announcers sold the Machines&mdash;a [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that was copied from the [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] character "Super Strong Machine", played by Japanese wrestler [[Junji Hirata]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/machines.html |title=The Machines' Profile |website=Online World of Wrestling |accessdate=July 8, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621210036/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/machines.html |archivedate=June 21, 2007 |deadurl=no}}</ref> &mdash;as "a new tag team from Japan" and claimed not to know the identities of the wrestlers, even though it was obvious to fans that it was André competing as the Giant Machine. Heenan, Studd, and Bundy complained to Tunney, who eventually told Heenan that if it could be proven that André and the Giant Machine were the same person, André would be fired. André thwarted Heenan, Studd, and Bundy at every turn. Then, in late 1986, the Giant Machine "disappeared," and André was reinstated. Foreshadowing André's heel turn, Heenan expressed his approval of the reinstatement but did not explain why.

==== Feud with Hulk Hogan (1987–1988) ====
[[File:Andre and Bobby Heenan.jpg|thumb|right|André was managed by [[Bobby Heenan]] (seen in front of him) during parts of his feud with [[Hulk Hogan]]]]
André agreed to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in early 1987 to be the counter to the biggest "[[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]" in professional wrestling at that time, [[Hulk Hogan]].{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=131}} On an edition of ''[[Piper's Pit]]'' in 1987, Hogan was presented a trophy for being the [[WWE World Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] for three years; André came out to congratulate him.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=132–133}} On the following week's ''Piper's Pit'', André was presented a slightly smaller trophy for being "the only undefeated wrestler in wrestling history." Although André had suffered a handful of [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] and [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] losses in WWF, he had never been pinned or forced to submit in a WWF ring. Hogan came out to congratulate André and ended up being the focal point of the interview. Apparently annoyed, André walked out in the midst of Hogan's speech.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=134–135}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm |title=WWF @ East Rutherford, NJ – Meadowlands – January 5, 1987 |website=The History of WWE |accessdate=April 2, 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510061259/http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm |archivedate=May 10, 2011 |deadurl=no}}</ref> A discussion between André and Hogan was scheduled, and on a ''Piper's Pit'' that aired February 7, 1987, the two met.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm |title=WWF @ Tampa, FL – SunDome – January 26, 1987 |website=The History of WWE |accessdate=March 27, 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510061259/http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm| archivedate=May 10, 2011 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Hogan was introduced first, followed by André. André was led by longtime rival Bobby Heenan.

Speaking on behalf of his new protégé, Heenan accused Hogan of only being André's friend so he would not have to defend his title against him. Hogan tried to reason with André but his pleas were ignored as he challenged Hogan to a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at [[WrestleMania III]]. Hogan was still seemingly in disbelief as to what André was doing, prompting Heenan to say "You can't believe it, maybe you'll believe this, Hogan" before André ripped the T-shirt and crucifix from Hogan, André's fingernail scratched Hogan's chest while ripping the shirt off which caused Hogan to bleed.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=136–139}}

Following Hogan's acceptance of André's challenge on a later edition of ''Piper's Pit'', the two were part of a 20-man over the top rope battle royal on the March 14 edition of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event results|Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' at the [[Joe Louis Arena]] in [[Detroit]].<ref name="history623">{{cite book |title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989 |last=Cawthon |first=Graham |pages=623 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}</ref> Although the battle royal was won by [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]], André claimed to have gained a psychological advantage over Hogan when he threw the WWF World Heavyweight Champion over the top rope. The match, which was actually taped on February 21, 1987,<ref name="history623"/> aired only two weeks before WrestleMania III to make it seem like Hogan had met his match in André the Giant.<ref>{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIfSsZa186w |title=Battle Royal with Hulk Hogan and Andre The Giant |date=July 8, 2013 |author=WWE |via=YouTube}}</ref>

At WrestleMania III, he was billed at {{convert|520|lb|kg|abbr=on}},<ref name=WMIII>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116004246/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm3/mainevent/ |title=WrestleMania III – André the Giant vs. Hulk Hogan – WWE Championship |website=[[WWE]] |accessdate=February 15, 2011|quote=It was billed as the biggest main event in the history of sports entertainment.

Another famous myth about the match is that no one, not even WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]], knew until the day of the event if André would lose the match. In reality André had agreed to lose the match some time before, mostly for health reasons, though he almost pinned Hogan (albeit unintentionally) in the first minute of the match after Hogan tried to slam him but could not hold his weight. Contrary to popular belief, it was not the first time that Hogan had successfully body slammed André in a WWF match. A then-heel Hogan slammed a then-face André following their match at the "[[Showdown at Shea]]" on August 9, 1980, though André was much lighter (around {{convert|470|lb|kg|abbr=on}}) and more athletic at the time (Hogan also slammed André in a match in [[Hamburg, Pennsylvania]], a month later).<ref>{{cite video |title=Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology|medium=DVD |publisher=[[WWE]]|date=2006}}</ref> This took place in the territorial days of American wrestling three years before WWF began national expansion, so many of those who watched WrestleMania III had never seen the Giant slammed (André had also previously allowed [[Harley Race]], [[Canek (wrestler)|El Canek]] and [[Stan Hansen]], among others, to slam him).{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=157}}<ref>{{cite book |title=King of the Ring: The Harley Race Story |last=Race |first=Harley |authorlink=Harley Race |page=90 |publisher=Sports Publishing L.L.C. |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58261-818-0}}</ref>

By the time of WrestleMania III, the WWF had gone national, giving more meaning to the André–Hogan match that took place then. The feud between André and Hogan simmered during the summer of 1987, as Roussimoff's health declined. The feud began heating up again when wrestlers were named the captains of rival teams at the inaugural [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] event. During their approximately one minute of actually battling each other during the match, Hogan dominated André and was on the brink of knocking him from the ring, but was tripped up by André's partners, Bundy and [[One Man Gang]], and would be counted out. André went on to be the sole survivor of the match, pinning [[Bam Bam Bigelow]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1987/mainevent/ |title=Survivor Series 1987 – Main Event |website=[[WWE]] |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref> before Hogan returned to the ring to attack André and knock him out of the ring. André later got revenge when, after Hogan won a match against Bundy on ''Saturday Night's Main Event'', he snuck up from behind and began choking Hogan to the brink of unconsciousness, not letting go even after an army of seven face-aligned wrestlers ran to the ring to try to pull André away; it took Hacksaw Jim Duggan breaking a 2-by-4 over André's back (which he no-sold) for him to let go, after which Hogan was pulled to safety. As was the case with the ''SNME'' battle royal a year earlier, the series of events was one of the pieces that helped build interest in a possible one-on-one rematch between Hogan and André, and to make it seem that André was certain to win easily when they did meet.

In the meantime, [[Ted DiBiase|the "Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase]] failed to persuade Hogan to sell him the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. After failing to defeat Hogan in a subsequent series of matches, DiBiase turned to André to win it for him.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=172–175}} André and DiBiase had teamed several times in the past, including in Japan and in the WWF in the late 1970s and early 1980s when both were faces, but this was not acknowledged during this new storyline. The earlier attack and DiBiase's insertion into the feud set up the Hogan-André rematch on ''The Main Event'', to air February 5, 1988, on a live broadcast on NBC. Acting as his hired gun, André won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hogan (his first singles title) in a match where it was later revealed that appointed referee [[Dave Hebner]] was "detained backstage", and a replacement (whom Hogan afterwards initially accused of having been paid by DiBiase to get plastic surgery to look like Dave,<ref>Hulk Hogan postmatch interview, ''The Main Event'' NBC television, February 5, 1988</ref> but in fact was revealed to have been his evil twin brother, [[Earl Hebner]]),<ref>"A ''WWF Magazine'' Investigative Report: Dave Hebner's Shadow," ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]'', June 1988, p. 30.</ref> made a three count on Hogan while his shoulders were off the mat.

After winning, André "sold" the title to DiBiase; the transaction was declared invalid by then-[[Professional wrestling authority figures|WWF president]] Jack Tunney and the title was declared vacant.<ref name=wwechamp>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454122 |title=Andre the Giant's first reign |website=[[WWE]] |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref> This was shown on WWF's [[NBC]] program ''[[WWF The Main Event|The Main Event]]''. At [[WrestleMania IV]], André and Hulk Hogan fought to a double disqualification in a WWF title tournament match (with the idea in the storyline saying that André was again working on DiBiase's behalf in giving DiBiase a clearer path in the tournament). Afterward, André and Hogan's feud died down after a steel cage match held at ''WrestleFest'' on July 31, 1988, in Milwaukee.

At the inaugural SummerSlam pay-per-view held at [[Madison Square Garden]], André and DiBiase (billed as [[The Mega Bucks]]) faced Hogan and WWF World Heavyweight Champion [[Randy Savage|"Macho Man" Randy Savage]] (known as [[The Mega Powers]]) in the main event, with [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse "The Body" Ventura]] as the special guest referee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1988/mainevent1/ |title=SummerSlam 1988 main event match details |website=[[WWE]] |accessdate=March 6, 2011}}</ref> During the match, the Mega Powers' manager, [[Miss Elizabeth]], (Savage's wife Elizabeth Hulette) distracted the Mega Bucks and Ventura when she climbed up on the ring apron, removed her yellow skirt and walked around in a pair of red panties. This allowed Hogan and Savage time to recover and eventually win the match with Hogan pinning DiBiase. Savage forced Ventura's hand down for the final three-count, due to Ventura's character historically being at odds with Hogan, and his unwillingness to count the fall.

Concurrent with the developing feud with the Mega Powers, André was placed in a feud with [[Jim Duggan]], which began after Duggan knocked out André with a two-by-four board during a television taping. Despite Duggan's popularity with fans, André regularly got the upper hand in the feud.

==== Feud with Jake Roberts and The Ultimate Warrior (1988–1989) ====
[[File:Jake Roberts and Andre.jpg|thumb|André feuded with [[Jake Roberts]] based on André's fear of snakes]]
André's next major feud was against [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]]. In this storyline, it was said André was [[Ophidiophobia|afraid of snakes]], something Roberts exposed on ''Saturday Night's Main Event'' when he threw his snake, Damien, on the frightened André; as a result, André suffered a [[kayfabe]] mild heart attack and vowed revenge. During the next few weeks, Roberts frequently walked to ringside during André's matches, causing him to run from the ring in fright (since he knew what was inside the bag). Throughout their feud (which culminated at [[WrestleMania V]]), Roberts constantly used Damien to gain a psychological edge over the much larger and stronger André.

In 1989, André and the returning Big John Studd briefly reprised their feud, beginning at WrestleMania V, when Studd was the referee in the match with Roberts, this time with Studd as a face and André as the heel. During the late summer and fall of 1989, André engaged in a brief feud, almost entirely consisting of [[house show]]s (non-televised events), with then-[[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]] [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]]. The younger Warrior, WWF's rising star, regularly [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Squash|squashed]] the aging André in an attempt to showcase his star quality and promote him as the "next big thing".{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=297–300}}<ref>{{cite book |title=Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling |last=Hart |first=Bret|authorlink=Bret Hart |page=233 |publisher=[[Hachette Book Group USA#Current imprints|Grand Central Publishing]]|year=2008 |isbn=978-0-446-53972-2}}</ref>

==== The Colossal Connection (1989–1990) ====
{{Main article|The Colossal Connection|l1=The Colossal Connection}}
In late 1989, André was joined with fellow [[The Heenan Family|Heenan Family]] member [[Tonga Fifita|Haku]] to form a new tag team called [[the Colossal Connection]], in part to fill a void left by the departure of [[Tully Blanchard]] and [[Arn Anderson]] ([[the Brain Busters]], who were also members of Heenan's stable) from the WWF, and also to continue to keep the aging André in the main event spotlight. The Colossal Connection immediately targeted WWF Tag Team Champions [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] (who had recently won the belts from the Brain Busters). At a television taping on December 13, 1989, the Colossal Connection defeated Demolition to win the titles.<ref name=tagchamp>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321111121 |title=Andre the Giant and Haku's first reign |website=[[WWE]]|accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref> André and Haku successfully defended their title, mostly against Demolition, until [[WrestleMania VI]] on April 1, 1990, when Demolition took advantage of a mistimed move by the champions to regain the belts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321241 |title=Demolition's third reign |website=[[WWE]] |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref> After the match, a furious Heenan blamed André for the title loss and after shouting at him slapped him in the face; an angry André responded with a slap of his own that sent Heenan staggering from the ring.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=321–322}} André also caught Haku's kick attempt, sending him reeling from the ring as well, prompting support for André and turning him face for the first time since 1987. Due to his ongoing health issues, André was not able to wrestle at the time of Wrestlemania VI and Haku actually wrestled the entire match against Demolition without tagging in André.

On weekend television shows following WrestleMania VI, Bobby Heenan vowed to spit in Andre's face when he came crawling back to the Heenan Family. However Andre would wrestle one more time with Haku, teaming up to face Demolition on a house show in Honolulu, HI on April 10. Andre was knocked out of the ring and The Colossal Connection lost via countout. After the match Andre and Haku would fight each other, marking the end of the team. Andre's final match of 1990 came at a combined WWF/All Japan/New Japan show on April 13 in Tokyo, Japan when teamed with [[Giant Baba]] to defeat Demolition in a non-title match. Andre would win by gaining the pinfall on [[Barry Darsow|Smash]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm |title=1990 |work=The History of WWE |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}</ref>

==== Sporadic appearances (1990–1992) ====
Andre returned in the winter of 1990, but it was not to the World Wrestling Federation. Instead, Andre made an interview appearance for Herb Abrams' fledgling Universal Wrestling Federation on October 11 in Reseda, CA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/indy/uwf/uwfcards.html |title=Herb Abram's Universal Wrestling Federation Cards |work=Pro-Wrestling History |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}</ref> (the segment aired in 1991). He appeared in an interview segment with [[Captain Lou Albano]] and put over the UWF.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSE0klOkkII |title=Andre the Giant & Lou Albano UWF January 1991 |author=Andre The Giant |date=October 23, 2014 |accessdate=June 1, 2016 |via=YouTube}}</ref> The following month, on November 30 at a house show in Miami, Florida the World Wrestling Federation announced Andre's return as a participant in the 1991 Royal Rumble (to be held in Miami, FL two months later). Andre was also mentioned as a participant on television but would ultimately back out due to a leg injury.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-VFCvdFtbc |title=WWF Primetime 1991 Royal Rumble Report |author=MrYoyo123321 |date=December 29, 2009 |accessdate=June 1, 2016 |via=YouTube}}</ref>

His on-air return finally came at [[WrestleMania VII]], when he came to the aid of [[Ray Traylor|The Big Boss Man]] in his match against [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]].{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=326}} André finally returned to action on April 26, 1991, in a six-man tag-team matchup when he teamed with the Rockers in a winning effort against Mr. Fuji and the Orient Express at a house show in Belfast, Northern Ireland.<ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm |title=1991 |work=The History of WWE |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}</ref> On May 10 he participated in a 17-man battle royal at a house show in Detroit.<ref name="thehistoryofwwe.com"/> (won by Kerry Von Erich). His last major WWF storyline following WrestleMania VII had the major heel managers (Bobby Heenan, [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Sherri]], [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]], and [[Mr. Fuji]]) trying to recruit André one-by-one, only to be turned down in various humiliating ways (e.g. Heenan had his hand crushed, Sherri received a spanking, Slick got locked in the trunk of the car he was offering to André and Mr. Fuji got a pie in his face). Finally, [[Jimmy Hart]] appeared live on ''WWF Superstars'' to announce that he had successfully signed André to tag-team with [[John Tenta|Earthquake]]. However, when asked to confirm this by [[Gene Okerlund]], André denied the claims. This led to Earthquake attacking André from behind (injuring his knee).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm |title=WWF Show Results 1991 |accessdate=March 5, 2011 |first=Graham |last=Cawthon |quote=(Date: May 6, 1991 Shown: June 1, 1991) Included an in-ring interview by Gene Okerlund in which André the Giant refused Jimmy Hart's offer to become his manager only to have his knee attacked by Earthquake, using Hart's megaphone}}</ref> Jimmy Hart would later get revenge for the humiliation by secretly signing [[Fred Ottman|Tugboat]] and forming [[the Natural Disasters]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm |title=WWF Show Results 1991 |accessdate=March 5, 2011 |first=Graham |last=Cawthon |quote=(Date: May 28, 1991 Shown: June 15, 1991)Earthquake & WWF Tag Team Champions the Nasty Boys (w/ Jimmy Hart) defeated Tugboat & the Bushwhackers at 4:05 when Earthquake pinned Luke with a sit-down splash after Tugboat attacked both of his teammates; after the match, Tugboat embraced with his new friends}}</ref> This led to André's final major WWF appearance at [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam '91]], where he seconded [[the Bushwhackers]] in their match against the Disasters.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=333}} André was on crutches at ringside, and after the Disasters won the match they set out to attack André, but the Legion of Doom made their way to ringside and got in between them and the Giant, who was preparing to defend himself with one of his crutches. The Disasters left the ringside area as they were outnumbered by the Legion of Doom, the Bushwhackers and André, who struck both Earthquake and Typhoon (the former Tugboat) with the crutch as they left. His final WWF appearance came at a house show in Paris, France, on October 9. He was in Davey Boy Smith's corner as the Bulldog faced Earthquake. Davey Boy hit Earthquake with André's crutch, allowing Smith to win.

His last U.S. television appearance was in a brief interview on [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s (WCW) ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XX: 20th Anniversary|Clash of the Champions XX]]'' special that aired on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 2, 1992.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=336}}

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling and Universal Wrestling Association (1990–1992) ===
After WrestleMania VI, André spent the rest of his in-ring career in [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) and Mexico's [[Universal Wrestling Association]], where he performed under the name "André el Gigante." He toured with AJPW three times per year, from 1990 to 1992, usually teaming with [[Giant Baba]] in tag team matches.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=335}} He also made a couple of guest appearances for Herb Abrams' [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], in 1991, feuding with [[Big John Studd]], though he never had a match in the promotion. He did his final tour of Mexico in 1992 in a selection of six-man tag matches alongside [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] and a variety of Lucha Libre stars facing among others [[Bad News Allen]] and future WWF Champion [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=926&page=4&year=1992&promotion=68 |title=Matches: Andre The Giant: Wrestlers Database |work=The Internet Wrestling Database |first=Philip |last=Kreikenbohm}}</ref> André wrestled his final match for AJPW in 1992. After his final match, André retired from professional wrestling in the process.

== Acting career ==
André branched out into acting again in the 1970s and 1980s, after a 1967 French boxing movie, making his USA acting debut playing a Sasquatch ("[[Bigfoot]]") in a two-part episode aired in 1976 on the 1970s television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=18–19}} He appeared in other television shows, including ''[[The Greatest American Hero]]'', ''[[B. J. and the Bear]]'', ''[[The Fall Guy]]'' and 1990's ''[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]''.

Towards the end of his career, André starred in several films. He had an uncredited appearance in the 1984 film ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' as Dagoth,{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=79}} the resurrected horned giant god who is killed by Conan ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]). That same year, André also made an appearance in ''[[Micki & Maude]]'' (billed as André Rousimmoff). He appeared most notably as Fezzik, his own favorite role,<ref name="official"/> in the 1987 film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''. Both the film and André's performance retain a devoted following.

In his last film, he appeared in a cameo role as a circus giant in the comedy ''[[Trading Mom]]'', which was released a year after his death.

== Personal life ==
Roussimoff had one daughter, Robin Christensen Roussimoff, who was born in 1979.<ref name=AEbio/>

André was mentioned in the ''1974 [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the highest-paid wrestler in history at that time. He had earned US $400,000 in one year during the early 1970s.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=18}}

Roussimoff has been unofficially crowned "the greatest drunk on Earth"{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=123}} for once consuming 119 {{convert|12|USfloz|adj=on}} beers (over 41 litres) in six hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://madconomist.com/5-coolest-beer-records |title=5 Coolest Beer Records |website=MadConomist |last=Davydov |first=Dmitri|date=May 20, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}</ref> On an episode of WWE's ''Legends of Wrestling'', [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]] said André once drank 156 {{convert|16|USfloz|ml|adj=on}} beers in one sitting, which was confirmed by [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]. [[The Fabulous Moolah]] wrote in her autobiography that André drank 127 beers in a [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], hotel bar and later passed out in the lobby. The staff could not move him and had to leave him there until he awoke.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ellison |first=Lillian |authorlink=The Fabulous Moolah |title=The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle|year=2003 |isbn=978-0-06-001258-8 |publisher=ReaganBooks |page=160}}</ref> A tale recounted by [[Cary Elwes]] in his book about the making of ''The Princess Bride'' has André falling atop somebody while drunk, after which the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] sent an undercover officer to follow Roussimoff around whenever he went out drinking in their city and make sure he didn't fall on anyone again.<ref>{{cite book| last=Elwes |first=Cary |authorlink=Cary Elwes |last2=Layden |first2=Joe |title=As You Wish: Inconceivable Tales from the Making of The Princess Bride |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4767-6402-3 |publisher=Touchstone |page=226}}</ref>

An [[urban legend]] exists surrounding André's 1987 surgery in which his size made it impossible for the [[anesthesiologist]] to estimate a dosage via standard methods; consequently, his alcohol tolerance was used as a guideline instead.<ref>[http://nypost.com/2013/10/27/true-stories-from-the-fake-world-of-pro-wrestling/ True stories from the fake world of wrestling], by David Shoemaker, at the ''[[New York Post]]''; published October 27, 2013; retrieved March 27, 2014</ref>

André was arrested by the [[Linn County, Iowa]], sheriff in 1989 and charged with assault after he allegedly roughed up a local television cameraman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/andregiantmug1.html |title=The Smoking Gun |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530034919/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/andregiantmug1.html |archivedate=May 30, 2008 |df=mdy }}.</ref>{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=300}}

[[William Goldman]], the author of the novel and the screenplay of ''The Princess Bride'', wrote in his nonfiction work ''[[Which Lie Did I Tell?]]'' that André was one of the gentlest and most generous people he ever knew. Whenever André ate with someone in a restaurant he would pay, but he would also insist on paying when he was a guest. After one meal, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] had quietly moved to the cashier to pay before André could, but then found himself being physically lifted, carried from his table, and deposited on top of his car by André and [[Wilt Chamberlain]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uproxx.com/videos/2012/09/arnold-schwarzeneggers-dinner-wilt-chamberlain-andre-giant/ |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Dinner With Wilt Chamberlain and Andre the Giant |first= |last= |website=Uproxx |date= |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}</ref>

While André was often billed as being 7'4" (224 cm) tall, his true height remains a point of conjecture among wrestling fans, with a number believing that his real height was closer to 6'11" (212 cm) given professional wrestling's reputation for over-exaggerating their characters to make them appear larger than life. This is despite there being no official references to André's height other than the 7'4" (the WWE website lists André as being 7'4"<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/superstars/andrethegiant Andre the Giant WWE bio]</ref>). Indeed, many stories have been made public including one in which he was reportedly told by the various promoters that he worked for never to stand next to or be photographed with [[basketball]] players such as the 7'1" (216 cm) Wilt Chamberlain or [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] who stood at 7'2" (218 cm) due to them actually being taller than he was.

Roussimoff died in his sleep of [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]] on the night of January 27, 1993, in a Paris hotel room. He was found by his [[chauffeur]].<ref name="official"/>{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=337}} He was in Paris attending his father's funeral.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3D6113AF932A05752C0A965958260&scp=1&sq=Andre&st=nyt |title=Andre the Giant, 46, Professional Wrestler (Obituary) |newspaper=New York Times |date=January 31, 1993 |accessdate=June 23, 2008}}</ref> His body was [[cremated]] according to his wishes and his ashes were scattered at his ranch ({{coord|35.116211|-79.80634|type:landmark_globe:earth_region:US-NC|name=Roussimoff Ranch}}) in [[Ellerbe, North Carolina]].<ref name=AEbio/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/video/4797970/ |title=Andre the Giant lived, died in small N.C. town |website=WRAL News |location=Raleigh, NC |date=March 24, 2009 |accessdate=June 8, 2012}}</ref>

== Other media ==
André has made appearances as himself in video games for years, as early as 1989's ''[[WWF Superstars]]'', where he appears as a non-playable [[Boss (video gaming)|game boss]] along with Ted DiBiase, fighting as their real-life tag team the Mega Bucks, he is also playable in ''[[WWF No Mercy]]'', ''[[WWE 2K14]]'', released in 2013, where he appears as one of many playable "legend" characters, and ''[[WWE 2K15]]'', as part of the ''Path of the [[The Ultimate Warrior|Warrior]]'' DLC. He also appears in ''[[WWE Day of Reckoning]]'', ''[[WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW]]'', ''[[WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006]],'' and ''[[WWE All Stars]]'' as a playable "legend" character. Andre currently appears in ''[[WWE 2K16]]'' and uses his character render shot picture from ''[[WWE 2K14]]'' which is given to him in this title. Andre the Giant and Haku are known as the Colossal Connection in this game. He also appears in WWE Legends of WrestleMania. He was also confirmed for ''[[WWE 2K17]]''.

On January 25, 2005, WWE released ''André The Giant'', a [[DVD]] focusing on the life and career of André.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00079I0BU |title=WWE – Andre the Giant |website=Amazon.com |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref> The DVD is a reissue of the out-of-print ''André The Giant'' [[VHS]] made by [[WWE Home Video|Coliseum Video]] in 1985, with commentary by [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] and [[Tazz]] replacing Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura's commentary on his WrestleMania match with Big John Studd. The video is hosted by [[Alfred Hayes (wrestler)|Lord Alfred Hayes]]. Later matches, including André's battles against Hulk Hogan while a heel, are not included on this VHS.

== Legacy ==
[[File:Big Show with Andre the Giant trophy.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Big Show]] – a wrestler often compared with André due to his size – was the winner of the 2015 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal at [[WrestleMania 31]], and is posing alongside the [[André the Giant Memorial Trophy]], which goes to the winner of the annual match]]
* In 1993, when the then-World Wrestling Federation created the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]], André the Giant was the inaugural and sole inductee<ref name="wwebio"/>
* André was the inspiration for the [[1998 in film|1998 film]] ''[[My Giant]]'', written by his friend [[Billy Crystal]], whom he had met during the filming of ''The Princess Bride''.
* Paul Wight, better known as [[Big Show]], is more similar in body structure to André than any other wrestler since André's death. He was originally billed as the son of André during his stint in WCW (when he was known as simply "the Giant") despite there being no biological relationship.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=341–342}} While also suffering from acromegaly, unlike André, Wight did get surgery on his [[pituitary gland]] in the early 1990s, which successfully halted the progress of his condition. The former wrestler [[Jorge González (wrestler)|Giant González]] suffered from problems similar to those that André had near the end of his life and died in 2010 due to [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] complications.
* In 1999, André was the subject of an episode of ''[[Biography (TV series)|A&E Biography]]'', titled ''André the Giant: Larger Than Life''. The documentary covered André's childhood and early life in France, as well as the beginning of his wrestling career, his struggles with acromegaly, his personal life, and his final years. André's brother, Jacques Roussimoff, was interviewed for the documentary, as were fellow wrestling personalities [[Gorilla Monsoon]], [[Tim White (wrestling)|Tim White]], [[Arnold Skaaland]], [[Vince McMahon]], [[Freddie Blassie]], [[Killer Kowalski]], [[Rene Goulet]], and Frenchy Bernard, as well as wrestling historian Sheldon Goldberg. Several of André's longtime hometown friends were interviewed as well. The documentary described André as pro wrestling's "first and only international attraction" and that "on his broad shoulders, wrestling rose from its status as a questionable sport to become big business, and some might argue, performance art."
