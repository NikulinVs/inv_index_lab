<!-- Epidemiology-->
Rising drug resistance can be attributed to three causes use of antibiotics: in the human population; in the animal population; and spread of resistant strains between human or non-human sources.<ref name="About Antimicrobial Resistance"/> Antibiotics increase [[selective pressure]] in bacterial populations, causing vulnerable bacteria to die—this increases the percentage of resistant bacteria which continue growing. With resistance to antibiotics becoming more common there is greater need for alternative treatments. Calls for new antibiotic therapies have been issued, but new drug-development is becoming rarer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cassir|first1=N|last2=Rolain|first2=JM|last3=Brouqui|first3=P|title=A new strategy to fight antimicrobial resistance: the revival of old antibiotics.|journal=Frontiers in microbiology|date=2014|volume=5|pages=551|pmid=25368610|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2014.00551|pmc=4202707}}</ref> There are multiple national and international monitoring programs for drug-resistant threats. Examples of drug-resistant bacteria included in this program are: [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), [[Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus'']] (VRSA), [[Beta-lactamase|extended spectrum beta-lactamase]] (ESBL), [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus'']] (VRE), [[Acinetobacter baumannii|multidrug-resistant ''A. baumannii'']] (MRAB).<ref name="CDC2013" />

<!-- History & economic costs-->
A [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) report released April 2014 stated, "this serious threat is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance—when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections—is now a major threat to public health."<ref name="who.int">[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/ "WHO's first global report on antibiotic resistance reveals serious, worldwide threat to public health"] Retrieved 2014-05-02</ref> Increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat include proposals for [[international treaty|international treaties]] on antimicrobial resistance.<ref name=Hoffman /> Worldwide antibiotic resistance is not fully mapped, but poorer countries with weak healthcare systems are more affected.<ref name="Swedish"/> According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]: "Each year in the United States, at least 2 million people become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and at least 23,000 people die each year as a direct result of these infections."<ref>https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/</ref>

Improper use of antibiotics can often be attributed to the presence of [[structural violence]] in particular regions.

Rather, it is normal practice to mix antibiotics with livestock food to promote healthier living conditions and to encourage animal growth.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Antibiotic Resistance {{!}} NRDC|url = http://www.nrdc.org/food/saving-antibiotics.asp|website = www.nrdc.org|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}</ref> The use of antibiotics in animals is to a large degree involved in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK97126/ The Resistance Phenomenon in Microbes and Infectious Disease Vectors: Implications for Human Health and Strategies for Containment: Workshop Summary].

They therefore greatly increase the cross-section for the evolution of resistance.

This mirrors the primary concerns in human medicine, where, in general, researchers and doctors were more concerned about effective but non-toxic doses of drugs rather than antibiotic resistance.

In 2001, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] estimated that greater than 70% of the antibiotics used in the U.S. are given to food animals (for example, chickens, pigs, and cattle), in the absence of disease.<ref name="TheRealNews-2014-05-18"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_environment/antibiotics_and_food/hogging-it-estimates-of-antimicrobial-abuse-in-livestock.html|title= Executive summary from the UCS report "Hogging It: Estimates of Antimicrobial Abuse in Livestock"|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|date=January 2001|ref=harv}}</ref> The amounts given are termed "sub-therapeutic", i.e., insufficient to combat disease. Despite no diagnosis of disease, the administration of these drugs (most of which are not significant to human medicine) results in decreased mortality and morbidity and increased growth in the animals so treated. It is theorized that sub-therapeutic dosages kills some, but not all, of the bacterial organisms in the animal — likely leaving those that are naturally antibiotic-resistant.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK114485/ Antibiotic Resistance - Linking Human And Animal Health: Improving Food Safety Through a One Health Approach Workshop Summary].

Some people have speculated that animals and fowl may have sub-clinical infections, which would be cured by low levels of antibiotics in feed, thereby allowing the creatures to thrive. No convincing evidence has been advanced for this theory, and the bacterial load in an animal is essentially unchanged by use of antibiotic feed additives. The mechanism of growth promotion is therefore probably something other than "killing off the bad bugs".

==Prevention==
[[File:Antibioticresistance diagram.png|thumb|350px|Mission Critical: Preventing Antibiotic Resistance (CDC report, 2014){{citation needed|date=December 2015}}]]

=== World Health Organization ===
In 2014, the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] stated:<ref name="who.int"/>
* People can help tackle resistance by:
** using antibiotics only when prescribed by a doctor;
** completing the full prescription, even if they feel better;
** never sharing antibiotics with others or using leftover prescriptions.
* Health workers and pharmacists can help tackle resistance by:
** enhancing infection prevention and control;
** only prescribing and dispensing antibiotics when they are truly needed;
** prescribing and dispensing the right antibiotic(s) to treat the illness.
* Policymakers can help tackle resistance by:
** strengthening resistance tracking and laboratory capacity;
** regulating and promoting appropriate use of medicines.
* Policymakers and industry can help tackle resistance by:
** fostering innovation and research and development of new tools;
** promoting cooperation and information sharing among all stakeholders.

===Duration of antibiotics===
Antibiotic treatment duration should be based on the infection and other health problems a person may have.<!-- <ref name=NPS2013/> "When optimising therapy for an infection consider the person’s immune status, the infecting agent and the focus of infection." --> For many infections once a person has improved there is little evidence that stopping treatment causes more resistance.<!-- <ref name=NPS2013/> "There does not appear to be strong evidence to support the notion that stopping antibiotics before the end of the recommended treatment contributes to increasing resistance" --> Some therefore feel that stopping early may be reasonable in some cases.<!-- <ref name=NPS2013/> "Therefore, in selected cases, it may be appropriate to stop antibiotic therapy early." --> Other infections, however, do require long courses regardless of whether a person feels better.<ref name=NPS2013/><!-- "For some infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, enterococcal endocarditis or tuberculosis, clear evidence favours prolonged treatment to prevent relapse" -->

===Antibiotic usage===
The [[Netherlands]] has the lowest rate of antibiotic prescribing in the [[OECD]], at a rate of 11.4 defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 people per day in 2011. [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]] also have lower prescribing rates, with Sweden's rate having been declining since 2007.

=== Strategies ===
Excessive antibiotic use has become one of the top contributors to the development of antibiotic resistance. Since the beginning of the antibiotic era, antibiotics have been used to treat a wide range of disease.<ref name=Andersson2011>{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersson D, Hughes D | title = Persistence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations | journal = FEMS Microbiol Rev | volume = 35 | pages = 901–911 | year = 2011 |  ref = harv | doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00289.x}}</ref> Overuse of antibiotics has become the primary cause of rising levels of antibiotic resistance. The main problem is that doctors are willing to prescribe antibiotics to ill-informed individuals who believe that antibiotics can cure nearly all illnesses, including viral infections like the common cold. In an analysis of drug prescriptions, 36% of individuals with a cold or an upper respiratory infection (both viral in origin) were given prescriptions for antibiotics.<ref name=Gilberg2003>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilberg K, Laouri M, Wade S, Isonaka S | title = Analysis of medication use patterns: apparent overuse of antibiotics and underuse of prescription drugs for asthma, depression, and CHF | journal = J Managed Care Pharm | volume = 9 | pages = 232–237 | year = 2003 |  ref = harv }}</ref> These prescriptions accomplished nothing other than increasing the risk of further evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

In a recent years, [[antimicrobial stewardship]] teams in hospitals have encouraged optimal use of antimicrobials.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Doron|first1=S|last2=Davidson|first2=LE|title=Antimicrobial stewardship.|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|date=November 2011|volume=86|issue=11|pages=1113–23|pmid=22033257|PMC=3203003|doi=10.4065/mcp.2011.0358}}</ref> The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are to help practitioners pick the right drug at the right dose and duration of therapy while preventing misuse and minimizing the development of resistance.

There have been increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat, including a proposal for international treaty on antimicrobial resistance. Further detail and attention is still needed in order to recognize and measure trends in resistance on the international level; the idea of a global tracking system has been suggested but implementation has yet to occur. A system of this nature would provide insight to areas of high resistance as well as information necessary for evaluation of programs and other changes made to fight or reverse antibiotic resistance.

On March 27, 2015, the White House released a comprehensive plan to address the increasing need for agencies to combat the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Task Force for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria developed ''The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria'' with the intent of providing a roadmap to guide the US in the antibiotic resistance challenge and with hopes of saving many lives. This plan outlines steps taken by the Federal government over the next five years needed in order to prevent and contain outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant infections; maintain the efficacy of antibiotics already on the market; and to help to develop future diagnostics, antibiotics, and vaccines.<ref name="whitehouse.gov">{{Cite web|title = FACT SHEET: Obama Administration Releases National Action Plan to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria|url = https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/27/fact-sheet-obama-administration-releases-national-action-plan-combat-ant|website = whitehouse.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}</ref>

The Action Plan was developed around five goals with focuses on strengthening health care, public health veterinary medicine, agriculture, food safety and research, and manufacturing. These goals, as listed by the White House, are as follows:
* Slow the Emergence of Resistant Bacteria and Prevent the Spread of Resistant Infections
* Strengthen National One-Health Surveillance Efforts to Combat Resistance
* Advance Development and use of Rapid and Innovative Diagnostic Tests for Identification and Characterization of Resistant Bacteria
* Accelerate Basic and Applied Research and Development for New Antibiotics, Other Therapeutics, and Vaccines
* Improve International Collaboration and Capacities for Antibiotic Resistance Prevention, Surveillance, Control and Antibiotic Research and Development
By following are goals set to meet by 2020:<ref name="whitehouse.gov"/>
* Establishment of antimicrobial programs within acute care hospital settings
* Reduction of inappropriate antibiotic prescription and use by at least 50% in outpatient settings and 20% inpatient settings
* Establishment of State Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Prevention Programs in all 50 states
* Elimination of the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion in food-producing animals.

The World Health Organization has promoted the first World Antibiotic Awareness Week running from 16–22 November 2015. The aim of the week is to increase global awareness of antibiotic resistance. It also wants to promote the correct usage of antibiotics across all fields in order to prevent further instances of antibiotic resistance.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Antibiotic Awareness Week|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2015/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/event/en/|website=World Health Organization}}</ref>

====Vaccines====
Microorganisms do not develop resistance to [[vaccine]]s because a vaccine enhances the body's immune system, whereas an antibiotic operates separately from the body's normal defenses. Furthermore, if the use of vaccines increase, there is evidence that antibiotic resistant strains of pathogens will decrease; the need for antibiotics will naturally decrease as vaccines prevent infection before it occurs.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Vaccines and antibiotic resistance|journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology|date = 2012-10-01|issn = 1879-0364|pmid = 22981392|pages = 596–602|volume = 15|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2012.08.002|first = Ravi P. N.|last = Mishra|first2 = Ernesto|last2 = Oviedo-Orta|first3 = Prachi|last3 = Prachi|first4 = Rino|last4 = Rappuoli|first5 = Fabio|last5 = Bagnoli}}</ref> However, new strains that escape immunity induced by vaccines may [[Evolution|evolve]]; for example, an updated [[influenza vaccine]] is needed each year.

While theoretically promising, antistaphylococcal vaccines have shown limited efficacy, because of immunological variation between ''Staphylococcus'' species, and the limited duration of effectiveness of the antibodies produced. Development and testing of more effective vaccines is underway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.homesteadschools.com/nursing/courses/Immunity/Chapter05.html |title=Immunity, Infectious Diseases, and Pandemics—What You Can Do |publisher=HomesteadSchools.com |accessdate=2013-06-12}}</ref>

====Alternating therapy====
Alternating therapy is a proposed method in which two or three antibiotics are taken in a rotation versus taking just one antibiotic such that bacteria resistant to one antibiotic are killed when the next antibiotic is taken.

====Development of new drugs====
Since the discovery of antibiotics, [[research and development]] (R&D) efforts have provided new drugs in time to treat bacteria that became resistant to older antibiotics, but in the 2000s there has been concern that development has slowed enough that seriously ill people may run out of treatment options.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wp.dh.gov.uk/publications/files/2013/03/CMO-Annual-Report-Volume-2-20111.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030190650/http://media.dh.gov.uk/network/357/files/2013/03/CMO-Annual-Report-Volume-2-20111.pdf |archivedate=22 June 2013 |title=Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer - Infections and the rise of antimicrobial resistance |publisher=UK NHS |date=2011}}</ref> Another concern is that doctors may become reluctant to perform routine surgeries because of the increased risk of harmful infection.<ref name="obama" /> Backup treatments can have serious side-effects; for example, treatment of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis can cause deafness or psychological disability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2013/06/04/188566805/moldova-grapples-with-whether-to-isolate-tb-patients |title=Moldova Grapples With Whether To Isolate TB Patients |publisher=NPR |date=4 June 2013 |accessdate=7 August 2016}}</ref>  The potential crisis at hand is the result of a marked decrease in industry R&D.<ref name="bbc">{{cite web |last=Walsh |first=Fergus |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21737844 |title=BBC News&nbsp;— Antibiotics resistance 'as big a risk as terrorism' – medical chief |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>  Poor financial investment in antibiotic research has exacerbated the situation.<ref name="TheRealNews-2014-05-18"/><ref name="bbc"/> The pharmaceutical industry has little incentive to invest in antibiotics because of the high risk and because the potential financial returns are less likely to cover the cost of [[drug development|development]] than for other pharmaceuticals.<ref>{{cite news | author = Nordrum, Amy | title = Antibiotic Resistance: Why Aren't Drug Companies Developing New Medicines to Stop Superbugs? | publisher = International Business Times | year = 2015}}</ref> In 2011, [[Pfizer]], one of the last major pharmaceutical companies developing new antibiotics, shut down its primary research effort, citing poor shareholder returns relative to drugs for chronic illnesses.<ref name="medpage">{{cite web |last= Gever |first=John |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/GeneralInfectiousDisease/24708 |title=Pfizer Moves May Dim Prospect for New Antibiotics |publisher=MedPage Today |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref> However, small and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies are still active in antibiotic drug research.

Among the proposals:
* Create a 'robust, standing national clinical trials network for antibiotic testing' which will promptly enroll patients once identified to be suffering from dangerous bacterial infections.  The network will allow testing multiple new agents from different companies simultaneously for their safety and efficacy.
* Establish a 'Special Medical Use (SMU)' pathway for FDA to approve new antimicrobial agents for use in limited patient populations, shorten the approval timeline for new drug so patients with severe infections could benefit as quickly as possible.
* Provide economic incentives, especially for development of new classes of antibiotics, to offset the steep R&D costs which drive away the industry to develop antibiotics.
The executive order also included a $20 million prize to encourage the development of diagnostic tests to identify highly resistant bacterial infections.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/antibiotics-rd-get-critical-lift-executive-order-obama-advisory-group/2014-09-19?utm_campaign=AddThis&utm_medium=AddThis&utm_source=twitter#.VBxQZCLB9Uo.twitter |title=Antibiotics R & D to get critical lift by executive order, Obama advisory group|author=Mullin, Emily|publisher=fiercebiotech.com|date=19 September 2014|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>

The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) collect data on antibiotic use in humans and in a more limited fashion in animals.<ref name="gao">{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/330/323097.html|title=GAO-11-801, Antibiotic Resistance: Agencies Have Made Limited Progress Addressing Antibiotic Use in Animals|publisher=gao.gov|accessdate=2014-01-25}}</ref>
The FDA first determined in 1977 that there is evidence of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains in livestock. The long-established practice of permitting OTC sales of antibiotics (including penicillin and other drugs) to lay animal owners for administration to their own animals nonetheless continued in all states.
In 2000, the FDA announced their intention to revoke approval of [[fluoroquinolone]] use in poultry production because of substantial evidence linking it to the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant ''[[Campylobacter]]'' infections in humans.

Growing U.S. consumer concern about using antibiotics in animal feed has led to greater availability of "antibiotic-free" animal products.  For example, chicken producer Perdue removed all human antibiotics from its feed and launched products labeled “antibiotic free” under the Harvestland brand in 2007. Consumer response was positive, and in 2014 Perdue also phased out ionophores from its hatchery and began using the “antibiotic free” labels on its Harvestland, Simply Smart, and Perfect Portions products.<ref>{{cite news |title=Perdue Sharply Cuts Antibiotic Use in Chickens and Jabs at Its Rivals|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/01/business/perdue-and-the-race-to-end-antibiotic-use-in-chickens.html|accessdate=August 12, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 31, 2015|author=Stephanie Strom}}</ref>

==Mechanisms==
{{see also|Microevolution}}

[[File:mecA Resistance.svg|thumb|thumbtime=1:40|Diagram depicting antibiotic resistance through alteration of the antibiotic's target site, modeled after MRSA's resistance to penicillin. Beta-lactam antibiotics permanently inactivate [[Penicillin-binding protein|PBP enzymes]], which are essential for bacterial life, by permanently binding to their active sites. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]], however, expresses a PBP that does not allow the antibiotic into its active site.]]

The four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are:
# Drug inactivation or modification: for example, enzymatic deactivation of [[Penicillin|''penicillin'' G]] in some penicillin-resistant bacteria through the production of [[Beta-lactamases|β-lactamases]]. Most commonly, the protective enzymes produced by the bacterial cell will add an acetyl or phosphate group to a specific site on the antibiotic, which will reduce its ability to bind to the bacterial ribosomes and disrupt protein synthesis.<ref name="Criswell, Daniel 2004">[Criswell, Daniel. "The "Evolution" of Antibiotic Resistance." Institute for Creation Research. N.p., 2004. Web. 28 Oct. 2014.]</ref>
# Alteration of target site: for example, alteration of [[Penicillin binding protein|PBP]]—the binding target site of penicillins—in [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and other penicillin-resistant bacteria. Another protective mechanism found among bacterial species is ribosomal protection proteins. These proteins protect the bacterial cell from antibiotics that target the cell’s ribosomes to inhibit protein synthesis. The mechanism involves the binding of the ribosomal protection proteins to the ribosomes of the bacterial cell, which in turn changes its conformational shape. This allows the ribosomes to continue synthesizing proteins essential to the cell while preventing antibiotics from binding to the ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis.
# Alteration of metabolic pathway: for example, some [[sulfa drugs|sulfonamide]]-resistant bacteria do not require [[para-aminobenzoic acid]] (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of [[folic acid]] and [[nucleic acids]] in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides, instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to using preformed folic acid.
# Reduced drug accumulation: by decreasing drug [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] or increasing active [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] (pumping out) of the drugs across the cell surface<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li XZ, Nikaido H | title = Efflux-Mediated Drug Resistance in Bacteria: an Update | journal = Drugs | volume = 69 | issue = 12 | pages = 1555–623 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19678712 | pmc = 2847397 | doi = 10.2165/11317030-000000000-00000 | ref = harv }}</ref> These specialized pumps can be found within the cellular membrane of certain bacterial species and are used to pump antibiotics out of the cell before they are able to do any damage.

</ref> and also of unlinked point mutations in the [[pathogen]] [[genome]] at a rate of about 1 in 10<sup>8</sup> per chromosomal replication. Mutations are rare but the fact that bacteria reproduce at such a high rate allows for the effect to be significant. A mutation may produce a change in the binding site of the antibiotic, which may allow the site to continue proper functioning in the presence of the antibiotic or prevent the binding of the antibiotic to the site altogether. Research has shown the bacterial protein LexA may play a key role in the acquisition of bacterial mutations giving resistance to quinolones and rifampicin. DNA damage induces the SOS gene repressor LexA to undergo autoproteolytic activity. This includes the transcription of genes encoding Pol II, Pol IV, and Pol V, which are three nonessential DNA polymerases that are required for mutation in response to DNA damage.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cirz RT, Chin JK, Andes DR, de Crécy-Lagard V, Craig WA, Romesberg FE | title = Inhibition of Mutation and Combating the Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = e176 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15869329 | pmc = 1088971 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030176 | ref = harv }}</ref> The antibiotic action against the pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure. Those bacteria with a mutation that allows them to survive live to reproduce. They then pass this trait to their offspring, which leads to the evolution of a fully resistant colony. Although these chromosomal mutations may seem to benefit the bacteria by providing antibiotic resistance, they also confer a cost of fitness. For example, a ribosomal mutation may protect a bacterial cell by changing the binding site of an antibiotic but it will also slow the process of protein synthesis.<ref name="Criswell, Daniel 2004"/> Additionally, a particular study specifically compared the overall fitness of antibiotic resistant strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium to their drug-sensitive revertants. They observed a reduced overall fitness in the antibiotic resistant strains, especially in growth rate.<ref>BR Levin, V Perrot, Nina Walker. Compensatory Mutations, Antibiotic Resistance and the Population Genetics of Adaptive Evolution in Bacteria. Genetics March 1, 2000 vol. 154 no. 3 985–997.</ref>

There are three known mechanisms of [[fluoroquinolone]] resistance. Some types of [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] pumps can act to decrease intracellular [[quinolone]] concentration.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Morita Y, Kodama K, Shiota S, Mine T, Kataoka A, Mizushima T, Tsuchiya T | title = NorM, a Putative Multidrug Efflux Protein, of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Its Homolog in Escherichia coli | journal = Antimicrob.

Finally, mutations at key sites in DNA gyrase or [[topoisomerase IV]] can decrease their binding affinity to quinolones, decreasing the drug's effectiveness.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robicsek A, Jacoby GA, Hooper DC | title = The worldwide emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = 629–40 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17008172 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70599-0 | ref = harv }}</ref>

Antibiotic resistance can also be introduced artificially into a microorganism through laboratory protocols, sometimes used as a [[selectable marker]] to examine the mechanisms of gene transfer or to identify individuals that absorbed a piece of DNA that included the resistance gene and another gene of interest. A recent study demonstrated that the extent of [[horizontal gene transfer]] among ''Staphylococcus'' is much greater than previously expected—and encompasses genes with functions beyond antibiotic resistance and virulence, and beyond genes residing within the [[mobile genetic elements]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan CX, Beiko RG, Ragan MA | title = Lateral Transfer of Genes and Gene Fragments in Staphylococcus Extends beyond Mobile Elements | journal = J Bacteriol | volume = 193 | issue = 15 | pages = 3964–3977 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21622749 | pmc = 3147504 | doi = 10.1128/JB.01524-10 | ref = harv }}</ref>

For a long time, it has been thought that, for a microorganism to become resistant to an antibiotic, it must be in a large population. However, recent findings show that there is no necessity of large populations of bacteria for the appearance of antibiotic resistance. We know now that small populations of E.coli in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant. Any heterogeneous environment with respect to nutrient and antibiotic gradients may facilitate the development of antibiotic resistance in small bacterial populations and this is also true for the human body. Researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance development is based on four SNP mutations in the genome of E.coli produced by the gradient of antibiotic. These mutations confer the bacteria emergence of antibiotic resistance.

====''Staphylococcus aureus''====
{{Main article|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus}}

''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (colloquially known as "Staph aureus" or a "Staph infection") is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the [[mucous membranes]] and the [[human skin]] of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which [[penicillin]] resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. [[Methicillin]] was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by [[oxacillin]] because of significant kidney toxicity. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) was first detected in Britain in 1961, and is now "quite common" in hospitals{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of [[sepsis]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all ''S. aureus'' infections in the [[United States|US]] are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, [[tetracycline]] and [[erythromycin]].

This left [[vancomycin]] as the only effective agent available at the time. However, strains with intermediate (4–8&nbsp;μg/ml) levels of resistance, termed glycopeptide-intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (GISA) or vancomycin-intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (VISA), began appearing in the late 1990s. The first identified case was in Japan in 1996, and strains have since been found in hospitals in England, France and the US. The first documented strain with complete (>16&nbsp;μg/ml) resistance to vancomycin, termed [[Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|vancomycin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (VRSA) appeared in the United States in 2002.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bozdogan B, Esel D, Whitener C, Browne FA, Appelbaum PC | title = Antibacterial susceptibility of a vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain isolated at the Hershey Medical Center | journal = Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 864–868 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14563898 | doi = 10.1093/jac/dkg457 }}</ref> However, in 2011, a variant of vancomycin has been tested that binds to the lactate variation and also binds well to the original target, thus reinstating potent antimicrobial activity.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Xie J, Pierce JG, James RC, Okano A, Boger DL | title = A Redesigned Vancomycin Engineered for Dual d-Ala-d-Ala and d-Ala-d-Lac Binding Exhibits Potent Antimicrobial Activity Against Vancomycin-Resistant Bacteria | journal = J.

====''Streptococcus'' and ''Enterococcus''====
''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (Group A ''Streptococcus'': GAS) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. Early treatment may reduce the risk of death from invasive group A streptococcal disease. However, even the best medical care does not prevent death in every case.

Resistance of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. Selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization.

Some research suggests the overuse of antibiotics in the raising of livestock is contributing to outbreaks of bacterial infections such as C. difficile.[16]

Antibiotics, especially those with a broad activity spectrum (such as clindamycin) disrupt normal intestinal flora. This can lead to an overgrowth of C. difficile, which flourishes under these conditions. Pseudomembranous colitis can follow, creating generalized inflammation of the colon and the development of "pseudomembrane", a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.[4] [[Clindamycin]]-resistant ''C. difficile'' was reported as the causative agent of large outbreaks of diarrheal disease in hospitals in New York, Arizona, Florida and Massachusetts between 1989 and 1992.<ref name=Johnson1999>{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson S, Samore MH, Farrow KA, Killgore GE, Tenover FC, Lyras D, Rood JI, DeGirolami P, Baltch AL, Rafferty ME, Pear SM, Gerding DN | title = Epidemics of diarrhea caused by a clindamycin-resistant strain of ''Clostridium difficile'' in four hospitals | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 341 | issue = 23 | pages = 1645–1651 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10572152 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199911253412203 | ref = harv }}</ref> Geographically dispersed outbreaks of ''C. difficile'' strains resistant to [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, were also reported in North America in 2005.<ref name=Loo_2005>{{cite journal |vauthors=Loo VG, Poirier L, Miller MA, Oughton M, Libman MD, Michaud S, Bourgault AM, Nguyen T, Frenette C, Kelly M, Vibien A, Brassard P, Fenn S, Dewar K, Hudson TJ, Horn R, René P, Monczak Y, Dascal A | title = A predominantly clonal multi-institutional outbreak of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 353 | issue = 23 | pages = 2442–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16322602 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa051639 | ref = harv }}</ref>

The researchers found that some antibiotic resistance in E. coli developed because of epigenetic inheritance rather than by direct inheritance of a mutated gene.

This could only be explained by epigenetics.<ref name="Adam2008"/> [[Epigenetics]] is a type of inheritance in which gene expression is altered rather than the genetic code itself. There are many modes by which this alteration of gene expression can occur, including [[DNA methylation|methylation of DNA]] and [[Histone|histone modification]]; however, the important point is that both inheritance of random mutations and epigenetic markers can result in the expression of antibiotic resistance genes.<ref name="Adam2008"/>

In the 1940s effective treatment with [[penicillin]] became available, but by the 1970s resistant strains predominated. Resistance to penicillin has developed through two mechanisms: chromasomally mediated resistance (CMRNG) and penicillinase-mediated resistance (PPNG). CMRNG involves step wise mutation of penA, which codes for the [[Penicillin binding proteins|penicillin-binding protein]] (PBP-2); mtr, which encodes an [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux pump]] that removes penicillin from the cell; and penB, which encodes the bacterial cell wall [[Porin (protein)|porins]].

===Viruses===
Specific [[antiviral drug]]s are used to treat some viral infections. These drugs prevent viruses from reproducing by inhibiting essential stages of the virus's replication cycle in infected cells. Antivirals are used to treat [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], [[influenza]], [[herpesviridae|herpes viruses]] including [[varicella zoster virus]], [[cytomegalovirus]] and [[Epstein-Barr virus]]. With each virus, some strains have become resistant to the administered drugs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lou|first1=Z|last2=Sun|first2=Y|last3=Rao|first3=Z|title=Current progress in antiviral strategies.|journal=Trends in pharmacological sciences|date=February 2014|volume=35|issue=2|pages=86–102|pmid=24439476|doi=10.1016/j.tips.2013.11.006}}</ref>

Of particular note, [[Fluconazole]]-resistant Candida species have been highlighted as a growing problem by the CDC.<ref name="CDC2013" /> More than 20 Candida species of Candida can cause [[Candidiasis]] infection, the most common of which is ''[[Candida albicans]]''. Candida yeasts normally inhabit the skin and mucous membranes without causing infection. However, overgrowth of Candida can lead to Candidiasis. Some Candida strains are becoming resistant to first-line and second-line [[Antifungal|antifungal agents]] such as [[Azole#Use as anti-fungal agents|azoles]] and [[echinocandin]]s.<ref name="CDC2013" />

===Parasites===

The [[protozoa]]n parasites that cause the diseases [[malaria]], [[trypanosomiasis]], [[toxoplasmosis]], [[cryptosporidiosis]] and [[leishmaniasis]] are important human pathogens.<ref name="pmid25057459">{{Cite journal | pmid = 25057459| pmc = 4095053| year = 2014| last1 = Andrews| first1 = K.

==Applications==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2015}}
Antibiotic resistance is an important tool for [[genetic engineering]]. By constructing a [[plasmid]] that contains an antibiotic-resistance gene as well as the gene being engineered or expressed, a researcher can ensure that, when bacteria replicate, only the copies that carry the plasmid survive. This ensures that the gene being manipulated passes along when the bacteria replicates.

In general, the most commonly used antibiotics in genetic engineering are "older" antibiotics. These include:
* [[ampicillin]]
* [[kanamycin]]
* [[tetracycline]]
* [[chloramphenicol]]

In industry, the use of antibiotic resistance is disfavored, since maintaining bacterial cultures would require feeding them large quantities of antibiotics. Instead, the use of [[auxotrophic]] bacterial strains (and function-replacement plasmids) is preferred.

==Society and culture==
For the [[fiscal year]] 2016 budget, President Obama has suggested to nearly double the amount of federal funding to "combat and prevent" antibiotic resistance to more than $1.2 billion.<ref>[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/27/fact-sheet-president-s-2016-budget-proposes-historic-investment-combat-a President’s 2016 Budget Proposes Historic Investment to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria to Protect Public Health] The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, January 27, 2015</ref>

Since the mid-1980s pharmaceutical companies have invested in medications for cancer or chronic disease that have greater potential to make money and have "de-emphasized or dropped development of antibiotics".<ref name="NYT_jan_21_2016" /> On January 20, 2016 at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], more than "80 pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies" from around the world called for 'transformational commercial models' at a global level to spur research and development on antibiotics and on the "enhanced use of diagnostic tests that can rapidly identify the infecting organism".<ref name="NYT_jan_21_2016">{{cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/business/to-fight-superbugs-drug-makers-call-for-incentives-to-develop-antibiotics.html?smid=tw-share | title=To Fight ‘Superbugs,’ Drug Makers Call for Incentives to Develop Antibiotics | publisher=New York Times | date=20 January 2016 | accessdate=24 January 2016 | author=Pollack, Andrew |series=Davos 2016 Special Report |location=Davos, Switzerland}}</ref>
