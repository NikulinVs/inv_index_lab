'''Botswana''' {{IPAc-en|b|ɒ|t|ˈ|s|w|ɑː|n|ə}}, officially the '''Republic of Botswana''' ({{lang-tn|Lefatshe la Botswana}}), is a [[landlocked country]] located in Southern Africa. The citizens refer to themselves as ''Batswana'' (singular: ''Motswana'').<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13040376| title=Botswana Profile}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=November 2016}} Formerly the British [[protectorate]] of [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]], Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] on 30 September 1966.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://generalknowledgefacts.com/2013/09/bechuanaland-was-former-name-of-botswana.html| title=Bechuanaland was the former name of Botswana }}</ref> Since then, it has maintained a strong tradition of stable [[representative democracy]], with a consistent record of uninterrupted democratic [[Elections in Botswana|elections]].

Botswana is topographically flat, with up to 70 percent of its territory being the [[Kalahari Desert]]. It is bordered by [[South Africa]] to the south and southeast, [[Namibia]] to the west and north, and [[Zimbabwe]] to the northeast. Its border with [[Zambia]] to the north near [[Kazungula, Zambia|Kazungula]] is poorly defined but at most is a few hundred metres long.<ref>

A mid-sized country of just over 2 million people, Botswana is one of the [[List of countries by population density|most sparsely populated]] nations in the world. Around 10 percent of the population lives in the capital and largest city, [[Gaborone]]. Formerly one of the poorest countries in the world—with a GDP per capita of about US$70 per year in the late 1960s—Botswana has since transformed itself into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. The economy is dominated by [[Mining industry of Botswana|mining]], cattle, and [[Tourism in Botswana|tourism]]. Botswana boasts a GDP ([[purchasing power parity]]) per capita of about $18,825 per year {{As of|2015|lc=y}}, which is one of the highest in Africa.<ref name="cia"/> Its high [[gross national income]] (by some estimates the fourth-largest in Africa) gives the country a modest standard of living and the highest [[Human Development Index]] of continental [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].<ref>[http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/GNI_PPP_of_countries.htm Gross national income (GNI) – Nations Online Project].

==History==
{{Main article|History of Botswana}}

===Early history===
[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumb|left|Starting fire by hand. [[San people]] in Botswana.]]
The history of Botswana starts more than 100,000 years ago, when the first humans inhabited the region. The original inhabitants of southern Africa were the Bushmen ([[San people|San]]) and [[Khoi]] peoples. Both speak [[Khoisan languages]] and lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s. About a thousand years ago, large chiefdoms emerged that were later eclipsed by the [[Great Zimbabwe]] empire, which spread into eastern Botswana.  Around 1300 CE, peoples in present-day [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] began to coalesce into three main linguistic and political groups, including the Batswana.

The Batswana (plural of "Motswana"), a term used also to denote all citizens of Botswana, remain the country's major ethnic group today. Prior to European contact, the Batswana lived as herders and farmers under tribal rule. As groups broke off and moved to new land, new tribes were created. Some human development occurred before the colonial period.

===Contacts with Europeans===
[[File:BARROW(1806) p455 BOOSHUANA VILLAGE.jpg|thumb|left|British colonial drawing of a "Booshuana village", 1806.]]
During the 1700s, the [[slavery in Africa|slave]] and [[ivory trade]]s were expanding. To resist these pressures, [[Shaka]], the king of the [[Zulu Empire]], mobilised an army. Conquered tribes began to move northwest into Botswana, destroying everything in their path. In their efforts to re-establish themselves at the end of this period, tribes began to exchange ivory and skins for guns with European traders, who had begun to reach the interior. [[Christian mission]]aries sent from Europe also spread to the interior, often at the invitation of tribal chiefs who wanted guns and knew that the presence of missionaries encouraged traders. By 1880 every major village had a resident missionary, and their influence became permanent. [[Christianization]] was completed in Botswana under the reign of king [[Khama III]] (reigned 1875–1923). There were eight principal tribes (or chiefdoms); the dominant was the [[Bangwaketse]].

In the late nineteenth century, hostilities broke out between [[Tswana people|Tswana]] inhabitants of Botswana and [[Southern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] tribes who were making incursions into the territory from the north-east. Tensions also escalated with the Dutch [[Boer]] settlers from the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] to the east. After appeals by the Batswana leaders Khama III, [[Bathoen]] and [[Sebele]] for assistance, the British Government put Bechuanaland under its protection on 31 March 1885.<ref>{{cite web|title=Botswana History|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/botswana/history|publisher=Lonely Planet|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref> The northern territory remained under direct administration as the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] and is modern-day Botswana, while the southern territory, [[British Bechuanaland]], became part of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] and is now part of the northwest province of South Africa. The majority of [[Setswana]]-speaking people today live in South Africa.

[[File:1960 6d Bechuanaland Protectorate stamp.jpg|thumb|Stamp of [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|British Bechuanaland]] from 1960]]
When the [[Union of South Africa]] was formed in 1910 out of the main British colonies in the region, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, [[Basutoland]] (now [[Lesotho]]) and [[Swaziland]] (the High Commission Territories) were not included, but provision was made for their later incorporation. However, their inhabitants began to be consulted by the UK, and although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred, the UK kept delaying; consequently, it never occurred. The election of the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist]] government in 1948, which instituted [[apartheid]], and South Africa's withdrawal from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1961, ended any prospect of incorporation of the territories into South Africa.

An expansion of British central authority and the evolution of tribal government resulted in the 1920 establishment of two advisory councils to represent both Africans and Europeans.<ref name=EISA>[http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/botoverview4.htm Botswana: Late British colonialism (1945–1966)] EISA. Accessed on 26 August 2016.</ref> The African Council consisted of the eight heads of the Tswana tribes and some elected members.<ref name=EISA /> Proclamations in 1934 regulated tribal rule and powers. A European-African advisory council was formed in 1951, and the 1961 constitution established a consultative legislative council.

===Independence===
[[File:SeretseKhama.jpg|thumb|150px|Sir [[Seretse Khama]], first President]]
In June 1964, the United Kingdom accepted proposals for a democratic self-government in Botswana. The seat of government was moved in 1965 from [[Mafikeng]] in South Africa, to the newly established [[Gaborone]], which sits near Botswana's border with South Africa. The 1965 constitution led to the first general elections and to independence on 30 September 1966.<ref>[http://www.britishempire.co.uk/article/fireworksatmidnight.htm Fireworks at Midnight]. Britishempire.co.uk. Retrieved on 27 October 2016.</ref>  [[Seretse Khama]], a leader in the independence movement and the legitimate claimant to the [[Bamangwato|Ngwato]] chiefship, was elected as the first President, subsequently re-elected twice.

The presidency passed to the sitting Vice-President, [[Quett Masire]], who was elected in his own right in 1984 and re-elected in 1989 and 1994. Masire retired from office in 1998, and was succeeded by [[Festus Mogae]], who was elected in his own right in 1999 and re-elected in 2004. The presidency passed in 2008 to [[Ian Khama]] (son of the first President), who had been serving as Mogae's Vice-President since resigning his position in 1998 as Commander of the [[Botswana Defence Force]] to take up this civilian role.

A long-running dispute over the northern border with [[Namibia]]'s [[Caprivi Strip]] was the subject of a ruling by the [[International Court of Justice]] in December 1999, which ruled that [[Kasikili Island]] belongs to Botswana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southern-eagle.com/namibia/namgeninfo.html |title=Namibia General Information |publisher=Southern-eagle.com |date=21 March 1990 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref>

==Geography==

{{Main article|Geography of Botswana|Climate of Botswana}}
[[File:Botswana map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Botswana map of [[Köppen climate classification]].]]
[[File:Flying-female-Lechwe.jpg|thumb|right|A [[lechwe]] in the [[Okavango Delta]]]]
At {{convert|581730|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} Botswana is the world's 48th-largest country. It is similar in size to [[Madagascar]] or [[France]]. It lies between latitudes [[17th parallel south|17°]] and [[27th parallel south|27°S]], and longitudes [[20th meridian east|20°]] and [[30th meridian east|30°E]].

The country is predominantly flat, tending toward gently rolling [[plateau|tableland]]. Botswana is dominated by the [[Kalahari Desert]], which covers up to 70% of its land surface. The [[Okavango Delta]], one of the world's largest inland [[River deltas|delta]]s, is in the northwest. The [[Makgadikgadi Pan]], a large [[salt pan (geology)|salt pan]], lies in the north.

The [[Limpopo River]] Basin, the major landform of all of southern Africa, lies partly in Botswana, with the basins of its tributaries, the [[Notwane River|Notwane]], [[Bonwapitse River|Bonwapitse]], [[Mahalapswe River|Mahalapswe]], [[Lotsane River|Lotsane]], [[Motloutse River|Motloutse]] and the [[Shashe River|Shashe]], located in the eastern part of the country. The Notwane provides water to the capital through the [[Gaborone Dam]]. The [[Cuando River|Chobe River]] lies to the north, providing a boundary between Botswana and Namibia's [[Zambezi Region]]. The Chobe River meets with the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]] at a place called [[Kazungula]] (meaning a small [[sausage tree]], a point where [[Sebitwane]] and his [[Makololo|Makololo tribe]] crossed the Zambezi into Zambia).

===Ecology===
[[File:Okavango Delta, Botswana (2685404064).jpg|thumb|Botswana has one of the largest elephant populations in Africa]]
[[File:Zebra Botswana edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plains zebra]] (''Equus quagga'') in [[Okavango Basin|Okavango]]]]
Botswana has diverse areas of wildlife habitat. In addition to the delta and desert areas, there are [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s, where [[blue wildebeest]], [[antelope]]s, and other mammals and birds are found. Northern Botswana has one of the few remaining large populations of the endangered [[African wild dog]]. [[Chobe National Park]], found in the [[Chobe District]], has the world's largest concentration of [[African elephant]]s. The park covers about {{convert|11000|km²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and supports about 350 species of birds.

The Chobe National Park and [[Moremi Game Reserve]] (in the Okavango Delta) are major tourist destinations. Other reserves include the [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]] located in the Kalahari desert in [[Ghanzi District]]; [[Makgadikgadi Pans National Park]] and [[Nxai Pan National Park]] are in [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]] in the [[Makgadikgadi Pan]]. Mashatu Game Reserve is privately owned: located where the [[Shashe River]] and Limpopo River meet in eastern Botswana. The other privately owned reserve is [[Mokolodi Nature Reserve]] near Gaborone. There are also specialised sanctuaries like the  Khama Rhino Sanctuary (for rhinoceros) and Makgadikgadi Sanctuary (for flamingos). They are both located in Central District.

===Environmental problems===

[[File:Adansonia digitata arbre MHNT.jpg|thumb|A [[baobab tree]] (''Adansonia digitata'')]]
Botswana faces two major [[Natural environment|environment]]al problems: drought and [[desertification]]. The desertification problems predominantly stem from the severe times of drought in the country. Three quarters of the country's human and animal populations depend on groundwater due to drought. [[Groundwater]] use through deep borehole drilling has somewhat eased the effects of drought. Surface water is scarce in Botswana and less than 5% of the agriculture in the country is sustainable by rainfall. In the remaining 95% of the country, raising livestock is the primary source of rural income. Approximately 71% of the country's land is used for communal [[grazing]], which has been a major cause of the desertification and the accelerating soil erosion of the country.<ref name="rala.is">{{cite web | publisher = Rala | location = IS | url = http://www.rala.is/rade/ralareport/darkoh.pdf | title = Darkoh | format = PDF}}</ref>

Since raising livestock has proven to be profitable for the people of Botswana, the land continues to be exploited. The animal populations have continued to dramatically increase. From 1966 to 1991 the livestock population has increased from 1.7 million to 5.5 million.<ref name = "rala.is" />{{rp |64}} Similarly, the human population has increased from 574,000 in 1971 to 1.5 million in 1995, nearly a 200% increase. "Over 50% of all households in Botswana own cattle, which is currently the largest single source of rural income." "Rangeland degradation or desertification is regarded as the reduction in land productivity as a result of overstocking and overgrazing or as a result of veld product gathering for commercial use. Degradation is exacerbated by the effects of drought and climate change."<ref name = "rala.is" /> Environmentalists report that the [[Okavango Delta]] is drying up due to the increased grazing of livestock.<ref name="afrol.com">{{cite web|url= http://www.afrol.com/articles/21794 |title= Botswana, US sign 'Debt-for-Nature' agreement |publisher=Afrol |accessdate = 4 July 2010}}</ref> The Okavango Delta is one of the major semi-forested wetlands in Botswana and one of the largest inland deltas in the world; it is a crucial ecosystem to the survival of many animals.<ref name="afrol.com"/>

The Department of Forestry and Range Resources has already begun to implement a project to reintroduce indigenous vegetation into communities in Kgalagadi South, Kweneng North and Boteti.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = UNCCD | url = http://www.unccd.int/iydd/documents/NOTCDIB.pdf | title = NOTCDIB | format = PDF}}</ref> Reintroduction of indigenous vegetation will help with the degradation of the land. The [[United States Government]] has also entered into an agreement with Botswana, giving them $7 million US dollars to reduce Botswana's debt by $8.3 million US dollars. The stipulation of the US reducing Botswana's debt is that Botswana will focus on more extensive [[Conservation biology|conservation]] of the land.<ref name="afrol.com"/>

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] claims that poverty is a major problem behind the [[overexploitation]] of resources, including land, in Botswana. To help change this the UNDP joined in with a project started in the southern community of Struizendam in Botswana. The purpose of the project is to draw from "indigenous knowledge and traditional land management systems". The leaders of this movement are supposed to be the people in the community, to draw them in, in turn increasing their possibilities to earn an income and thus decreasing poverty. The UNDP also stated that the government has to effectively implement policies to allow people to manage their own local resources and are giving the government information to help with policy development<ref name = "afrol1">{{cite web | url = http://www.afrol.com/articles/13090 | title = Botswana villages fighting desertification |publisher=Afrol |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>

==Politics and government==
[[File:BotswanaParliament.jpg|thumb|House of the Parliament of Botswana in [[Gaborone]]]]
{{Main article|Politics of Botswana|Human rights in Botswana}}

The constitution of Botswana is the [[rule of law]] which protects the citizens of Botswana and represents their rights. The politics of Botswana take place in a framework of a [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[President of Botswana]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Parliament of Botswana]]. [[Botswana general election, 2014|The most recent election]], its eleventh, was held on 24 October 2014. Since independence was declared, the party system has been dominated by the [[Botswana Democratic Party]].

===Judiciary===
The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Botswana 1996 (rev. 2002)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Botswana_2002?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref> Botswana ranks 30th out of 167 states in the 2012 [[Democracy Index]].<ref name=index2012>{{cite web |url=http://pages.eiu.com/rs/eiu2/images/Democracy-Index-2012.pdf |title=Democracy index 2012: Democracy at a standstill |publisher=Economist Intelligence Unit |date=14 March 2013 |accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref> According to [[Transparency International]], Botswana is the least corrupt country in Africa and ranks close to Portugal and South Korea.<ref>Transparency International [http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table 2008 Corruption Perception Index 2008]. Retrieved 7–23–09.</ref>

It consists of a typical court system of local Magistrates Courts, a High Court and a Court of Appeal. The High Court is a superior court of record with unlimited original jurisdiction to hear and determine any criminal, civil or constitutional cases under any law. Appeals can be heard by the Court of Appeal. The Head of the High Court is the Chief Justice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.bw/about%20us/background-judiciary|title=Administration of Justice|publisher= Republic of Botswana Administarion of Justice|accessdate = 4 March 2016}}</ref>

The Court of Appeal is the highest and final court in the country and deals with appeals from the High Court and the Industrial Court. The Head of the Court of Appeal is the Judge President.

Judges are appointed by the President of Botswana on the recommendation of the Judicial Services Commission.

The [http://www.mti.gov.bw/ Ministry of Trade and Industry of Botswana] is responsible for promoting [[business development]] throughout the country. According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], economic growth averaged over 9% per year from 1966 to 1999.

An array of financial institutions populates the country's financial system, with pension funds and commercial banks being the two most important segments by asset size. Banks remain profitable, well-capitalised, and liquid, as a result of growing national resources and high interest rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/botswana/botswana-financial-sector-profile.html |title=MFW4A Botswana Financial Sector Profile |publisher=Mfw4a.org |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> The [[Bank of Botswana]] serves as a [[central bank]].

The constitution provides for an independent judiciary, and the government respects this in practice. The legal system is sufficient to conduct secure commercial dealings, although a serious and growing backlog of cases prevents timely trials. The protection of intellectual property rights has improved significantly. Botswana is ranked second only to South Africa among sub-Saharan Africa countries in the 2014 International Property Rights Index.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://internationalpropertyrightsindex.org/countries?r=A&f=ipri&o=desc | title=The International Property Rights Index 2014: Africa by Score | publisher=The International Property Rights Index | accessdate=23 August 2015}}</ref>

While generally open to foreign participation in its economy, Botswana reserves some sectors for citizens. Increased foreign investment plays a significant role in the privatisation of state-owned enterprises. Investment regulations are transparent, and bureaucratic procedures are streamlined and open, although somewhat slow. Investment returns such as profits and dividends, debt service, capital gains, returns on intellectual property, royalties, franchise's fees, and service fees can be repatriated without limits.

Botswana imports refined petroleum products and electricity from South Africa. There is some domestic production of electricity from coal.

==Demographics==

{{Main article|Demographics of Botswana}}
[[File:Gathering food in the Okavango.jpg|thumb|A girl in the [[Okavango Delta]]]]

The [[Tswana people|Tswana]] are the majority ethnic group in Botswana, making up 79% of the population. The largest minority ethnic groups are the [[BaKalanga]], and [[San people|San]] or [[AbaThwa]], also known as Basarwa. Other tribes are [[Bayei]], Bambukushu, [[Basubia]], Baherero and Bakgalagadi. In addition, there are small numbers of whites and Indians, both groups being roughly equally small in number. [[Indians in Botswana|Botswana's Indian]] population is made up of many Indian-Africans of several generations, with some having migrated from Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, South Africa, and so on, as well as first generation Indian immigrants. The white population speaks English and [[Afrikaans]] and makes up roughly 3% of the population.

Since 2000, because of deteriorating economic conditions in Zimbabwe, the number of [[Zimbabweans in Botswana]] has risen into the tens of thousands.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=National and international responses to the Zimbabwean exodus: implications for the refugee protection regime|publisher=Policy Development and Evaluation Service, [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]|series=Research Papers|volume=175|last=Betts|first=Alexander|last2=Kaytaz|first2=Ezra|year=2009|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/retrieveattachments?openagent&shortid=MINE-7UL4R6&file=Full_Report.pdf}}</ref>

===Language===

{{Main article|Languages of Botswana|Setswana}}
The official language of Botswana is English although [[Tswana language|Setswana]] is widely spoken across the country. In Setswana, [[prefix]]es are more important than they are in many other languages. These prefixes include ''Bo'', which refers to the country, ''Ba'', which refers to the people, ''Mo'', which is one person, and ''Se'' which is the language. For example, the main ethnic group of Botswana is the Tswana people, hence the name Botswana for its country. The people as a whole are Batswana, one person is a Motswana, and the language they speak is Setswana.

Other languages spoken in Botswana include [[Kalanga language|Kalanga]] (sekalanga), [[Tshwa language|Sarwa]] (sesarwa), [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]], [[Taa language|!Xóõ]] and, in some parts, [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]].

There are also congregations of Lutherans, Baptists, Roman Catholics, Latter-day Saints (Mormons), the Dutch Reformed Church, Mennonites, Seventh-day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses in the country. In Gaborone, a Lutheran History Centre is open to the public.

According to the 2001 census, the country has around 5,000 Muslims, mainly from South Asia, 3,000 [[Hindus]] and 700 [[Baha'is]]. Approximately 20% of citizens espouse no religion. Religious services are well attended in both rural and urban areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90083.htm |work=U.S. Department of State |date=14 September 2007 |title=Botswana.

[[File:Khutse Kalahari Lodge.jpg|thumb|A [[rondavel]] at a lodge near the Kalahari Desert.]]
Besides referring to the language of the dominant people groups in Botswana, Setswana is the adjective used to describe the rich cultural traditions of the Batswana—whether construed as members of the Tswana ethnic groups or of all citizens of Botswana.In Botswana most of the tribes have different ways that they use to greet one another, but for easy communication and connection batswana use a three way hand shake or one can just greet another by saying "Dumelang" as a way of saying "hello" without having to use hand shakes. In community celebrations like Dikgafela or during marriage ceremonies batswana women show exitement and happiness by the use of ululations as part of their culture.

===Music===

{{Main article|Music of Botswana}}
Botswana music is mostly vocal and performed, sometimes without drums depending on the occasion; it also makes heavy use of string instruments. Botswana folk music has instruments such as Setinkane (a Botswana version of miniature piano), Segankure/Segaba (a Botswana version of the Chinese instrument Erhu), Moropa (Meropa -plural) (a Botswana version of the many varieties of drums), phala (a Botswana version of a whistle used mostly during celebrations, which comes in a variety of forms). Botswana cultural musical instruments are not confined only to the strings or drums. the hands are used as musical instruments too, by either clapping them together or against phathisi (goat skin turned inside out wrapped around the calf area; it is only used by men) to create music and rhythm. For the last few decades, the guitar has been celebrated as a versatile music instrument for Tswana music as it offers a variety in string which the Segaba instrument does not have. It is the outsider that found a home within the culture. The highlight of any celebration or event that shows especially happiness is the dancing. This differs by regime, age, gender and status in the group or if it's a tribal activity, status in the community. The national anthem is [[Fatshe leno la rona]]. Written and composed by Kgalemang Tumediso Motsete, it was adopted upon independence in 1966. {{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Visual arts===
[[File:San apron-Botswana.jpg|thumb|left|Textile art]]
{{Main article|Art of Botswana}}
In the northern part of Botswana, women in the villages of [[Etsha]] and [[Gumare]] are noted for their skill at crafting baskets from [[Mokola Palm]] and local [[dye]]s. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage, large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. The artistry of these baskets is being steadily enhanced through colour use and improved designs as they are increasingly produced for international markets.

Other notable artistic communities include [[Thamaga Pottery]] and [[Oodi Weavers]], both located in the south-eastern part of Botswana.

The oldest paintings from both Botswana and South Africa depict hunting, animal and human figures, and were made by the Khoisan (!Kung San/Bushmen) over twenty thousand years ago within the [[Kalahari]] desert.

===Food===

==Education==

[[File:GABS-UB Courtyard.JPG|thumb|Buildings of the new and old Botswana university. Botswana's economic growth has had a positive impact on the university.]]
{{Main article|Education in Botswana}}

Botswana has made great strides in educational development since independence in 1966. At that time there were very few graduates in the country and only a very small percentage of the population attended secondary school. Botswana increased its adult literacy rate from 69% in 1991 to 83% in 2008.<ref name="ref">{{cite web|url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org |title=UNESCO Institute for Statistics |publisher=Stats.uis.unesco.org |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref>

With the discovery of diamonds and the increase in government revenue that this brought, there was a huge increase in educational provision in the country. All students were guaranteed ten years of basic education, leading to a Junior Certificate qualification. Approximately half of the school population attends a further two years of secondary schooling leading to the award of the [[Botswana General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (BGCSE). Secondary education in Botswana is neither free nor compulsory.

After leaving school, students can attend one of the seven technical colleges in the country, or take vocational training courses in [[teaching]] or [[nursing]]. The best students enter the [[University of Botswana]], [[Botswana College of Agriculture]], [[Botswana International University of Science and Technology]] and the [[Botswana Accountancy College]] in Gaborone. Many other students end up in the numerous private tertiary education colleges around the country. Notable amongst these is [http://www.bothocollege.ac.bw/ Botho University], the country's first private university which offers undergraduate programmes in Accounting, Business and Computing. Another international university is the [[Limkokwing University of Creative Technology]] which offers various associate degrees in Creative Arts.<ref>[http://www.limkokwing.net/botswana/ Limkokwing University of Creative Technology]. Limkokwing.net. Retrieved on 27 October 2016.</ref>  Other tertiary institutions include [http://www.baisago.co.bw/ Ba Isago], ABM University College the largest school of business and management, [http://www.neweracollege.ac.bw/ New Era], [http://www.gips.ac.bw/gips.php Gaborone Institute of Professional Studies] etc. Tremendous strides in providing quality education have been made by private education providers such that a large number of the best students in the country are now applying to them as well. A vast majority of these students are government sponsored. The nation's second international university, the [[Botswana International University of Science and Technology]], was  completed in [[Palapye]] in 2011.

The quantitative gains have not always been matched by qualitative ones. Primary schools in particular still lack resources, and the teachers are less well paid than their secondary school colleagues. The [[Botswana Ministry of Education]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.bw/index.php?id=10 |title=Ministry of Education and Skills Development: Home |publisher=Moe.gov.bw |date=27 July 2011 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> is working to establish libraries in primary schools in partnership with the [[African Library Project]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africanlibraryproject.org/about-us/our-partners/139-library-partner-botswana-ministry-of-education |title=Library Partner – Botswana Ministry of Education |publisher=Africanlibraryproject.org |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> The [[Government of Botswana]] hopes that by investing a large part of national income in education, the country will become less dependent on diamonds for its economic survival, and less dependent on expatriates for its skilled workers.<ref name="UNEVOC">[http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=BWA UNESCO-UNEVOC's Botswana profile].

In January 2006, Botswana announced the reintroduction of school fees after two decades of free state education<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4601360.stm Botswana brings back school fees]. BBC News (11 January 2006).</ref> though the government still provides full scholarships with living expenses to any Botswana citizen in university, either at the University of Botswana or if the student wishes to pursue an education in any field not offered locally, such as medicine, they are provided with a full scholarship to study abroad.

The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Botswana was estimated at 25.4% for adults aged 15–49 in 2009 and 21.9% in 2013,<ref name= Gap />{{rp|A8}} exceeded by Lesotho and Swaziland in sub-Saharan African nations. This places Botswana at the third highest prevalence in the world, in 2013, while "leading the way in prevention and treatment programmes".<ref name= Avert>{{cite web |url= http://www.avert.org/aidsbotswana.htm |title= HIV and Aids in Botswana |publisher=Avert International Aids Charity |accessdate= 21 June 2016}}</ref> In 2003, the government began a comprehensive program involving free or cheap generic [[Antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral]] drugs as well as an information campaign designed to stop the spread of the virus; in 2013, over 40% of adults in Botswana had access to antiretroviral therapy.<ref name= Gap />{{rp |28}} In the age group of 15–19 years old, prevalence was estimated at about 6% for females and 3.5% for males in 2013,<ref name= Gap />{{rp|33}} and for the 20–24 age group, 15% for females and 5% for males<ref name=Gap />{{rp |33}} Botswana is one of 21 priority countries identified by the UN AIDS group in 2011 in the Global Plan to eliminate new HIV infections among children and to keep their mothers alive.<ref name= Gap />{{rp |37}} From 2009 to 2013, the country saw a decrease over 50% in new HIV infections in children.<ref name=Gap />{{rp |38}} A further measure of the success, or reason for hope, in dealing with HIV in Botswana, is that less than 10% of pregnant HIV-infected women were not receiving antiretroviral medications in 2013, with a corresponding large decrease (over 50%) in the number of new HIV infections in children under 5.<ref name= Gap />{{rp |39, 40}} Among the UN Global Plan countries, people living with HIV in Botswana have the highest percentage receiving antiretroviral treatment: about 75% for adults (age 15+) and about 98% for children.<ref name= Gap />{{rp |237}}

With a nationwide Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission program, Botswana has reduced HIV transmission from infected mothers to their children from about 40% to just 4%. Under the leadership of [[Festus Mogae]], the Government of Botswana solicited outside help in fighting HIV/AIDS and received early support from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], the Merck Foundation, and together formed the African Comprehensive HIV AIDS Partnership (ACHAP).  Other early partners include the [[Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute]], of the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] and the [[Botswana-UPenn Partnership]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report, universal access to treatment – defined as 80% coverage or greater – has been achieved in Botswana.<ref>{{Citation |format= PDF |url= http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2011/JC2216_WorldAIDSday_report_2011_en.pdf |title=World AIDS Day Report |year=2011 |publisher= UNAIDS}}</ref>

Potential reasons for Botswana's high HIV prevalence include concurrent sexual partnerships, transactional sex, cross-generational sex, and a significant number of people who travel outside of their local communities in pursuit of work. The [[polyamory|polyamorous]] nature of many sexual relationships further impacts the health situation, to the extent that it has given rise to a love vocabulary<ref>{{cite web |title= Exposing Botswana's Love Vocabulary | publisher = Dr. Shem | url= http://drshem.com/2011/06/16/exposing-botswana-love-vocabulary/ |date=16 June 2011 |accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref> that is unique to the region.
