'''Acetylene''' ([[Chemical nomenclature|systematic name]]: '''ethyne''') is the [[chemical compound]] with the formula C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>.

As an alkyne, acetylene is [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] because its two carbon atoms are [[Chemical bond|bonded]] together in a [[triple bond]]. The carbon–carbon triple bond places all four atoms in the same straight line, with CCH bond angles of 180°.<ref>Whitten K.W., Gailey K.D. and Davis R.E.

==Discovery==
Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by [[Edmund Davy]], who identified it as a "new carburet of hydrogen".<ref>Edmund Davy (August 1836) [https://books.google.com/books?id=grtZAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA1-PA62#v=onepage&q&f=false "Notice of a new gaseous bicarburet of hydrogen,"], ''Report of the Sixth Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science'' … , '''5''' :  62-63.</ref><ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> It was rediscovered in 1860 by French chemist [[Marcellin Berthelot]], who coined the name "acétylène".<ref>Bertholet (1860) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3007r/f817.image "Note sur une nouvelle série de composés organiques, le quadricarbure d'hydrogène et ses dérivés"] (Note on a new series of organic compounds, tetra-carbon hydride and its derivatives), ''Comptes rendus'', series 3, '''50''' :  805–808.</ref>
Berthelot's empirical formula for acetylene (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>), as well as the alternative name "quadricarbure d'hydrogène" (''hydrogen quadricarbide'') were incorrect because chemists at that time used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12).
Berthelot was able to prepare this gas by passing vapours of organic compounds (methanol, ethanol, etc.) through a red-hot tube and collecting the [[effluent]]. He also found acetylene was formed by sparking electricity through mixed [[cyanogen]] and [[hydrogen]] gases. Berthelot later obtained acetylene directly by passing hydrogen between the poles of a [[arc lamp|carbon arc]].<ref>Berthelot (1862) [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30115/f640.image.langEN "Synthèse de l'acétylène par la combinaison directe du carbone avec l'hydrogène"] (Synthesis of acetylene by the direct combination of carbon with hydrogen), ''Comptes rendus'', series 3, '''54''' :  640-644.</ref><ref>[http://chestofbooks.com/crafts/metal/Welding-Cutting/Acetylene.html Acetylene]</ref> Commercially available acetylene gas could smell foul due to the common impurities [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[phosphine]].

==Preparation==
Since the 1950s, acetylene has mainly been manufactured by the partial [[combustion]] of [[methane]]<ref name=Ullmann /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Habil|first1=Phil|last2=Sachsse|first2=Hans|title=Herstellung von Acetylen durch unvollständige Verbrennung von Kohlenwasserstoffen mit Sauerstoff [Production of acetylene by incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons with oxygen]|journal=Chemie Ingenieur Technik|date=1954|volume=26|issue=5|pages=245–253|doi=10.1002/cite.330260502}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Habil|first1=Phil|last2=Bartholoméa|first2=E.|title=Probleme großtechnischer Anlagen zur Erzeugung von Acetylen nach dem Sauerstoff-Verfahren [Problems of large-scale plants for the production of acetylene by the oxygen method]|journal=Chemie Ingenieur Technik|date=1954|volume=26|issue=5|pages=253–258|doi=10.1002/cite.330260503}}</ref> or appears as a side product in the [[ethylene]] stream from [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] of [[hydrocarbon]]s.

Until the 1950s, when [[petroleum|oil]] supplanted [[coal]] as the chief source of [[redox|reduced]] carbon, acetylene (and the aromatic fraction from [[coal tar]]) was the main source of organic chemicals in the chemical industry. It was prepared by the [[hydrolysis]] of [[calcium carbide]], a reaction discovered by [[Friedrich Wöhler]] in 1862<ref>Wohler (1862) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6zIzAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA220#v=onepage&q&f=false "Bildung des Acetylens durch Kohlenstoffcalcium"] (Formation of actylene by calcium carbide), ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''124''' :  220.</ref> and still familiar to students:
: CaC<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O → Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>

Calcium carbide production requires extremely high temperatures, ~2000&nbsp;°C, necessitating the use of an [[electric arc furnace]]. In the US, this process was an important part of the late-19th century revolution in chemistry enabled by the massive [[hydroelectric power]] project at [[Niagara Falls]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Horace|title=Manufacture of Cyanamide|journal=The Chemical News and the Journal of Physical Science|year=1919|volume=117|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5SAzAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA232&dq=calcium+carbide&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hpy3UoPBJIrqoASRxYKwCA&ved=0CHEQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q=calcium%20carbide&f=false|accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref>

==Bonding==
In terms of [[valence bond theory]], in each carbon atom the 2s [[Atomic orbital|orbital]] [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridizes]] with one 2p orbital thus forming an sp hybrid. The other two 2p orbitals remain unhybridized. The two ends of the two sp hybrid [[orbital overlap]] to form a strong [[Sigma bond|σ valence bond]] between the carbons, while on each of the other two ends hydrogen atoms attach also by σ bonds. The two unchanged 2p orbitals form a pair of weaker [[pi bond|π bonds]].<ref>Organic Chemistry 7th ed. by J. McMurry, Thomson 2008</ref>

Since acetylene is a linear [[molecular symmetry|symmetrical molecule]], it possesses the D<sub>∞h</sub> [[Molecular symmetry#Point group|point group]].<ref>{{Housecroft3rd|pages=94–95}}</ref>

==Physical properties==

===Changes of state===
At atmospheric pressure, acetylene cannot exist as a liquid and does not have a melting point. The [[triple point]] on the [[phase diagram]] corresponds to the melting point (−80.8&nbsp;°C) at the minimum pressure at which liquid acetylene can exist (1.27 atm). At temperatures below the triple point, solid acetylene can change directly to the [[vapour]] (gas) by [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]. The sublimation point at atmospheric pressure is −84.0°C.<ref>Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (60th ed., CRC Press 1979-80), p.C-303 in Table ''Physical Constants of Organic Compounds'' (listed as ''ethyne'')</ref>

===Other===
The [[adiabatic]] flame temperature in air at [[atmospheric pressure]] is 2534&nbsp;°C. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Acetylene gas can be dissolved in [[acetone]] or [[dimethylformamide]] in room temperature and 1 atm. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Applications==

===Welding===
Approximately 20 percent of acetylene is supplied by the [[Industrial gas|industrial gases industry]] for [[oxyacetylene]] [[gas welding]] and [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|cutting]] due to the high temperature of the flame; combustion of acetylene with oxygen produces a flame of over {{convert|3600|K|C F}}, releasing 11.8&nbsp;[[Kilojoule|kJ]]/g. Oxyacetylene is the hottest burning common fuel gas.<ref name=Linde2013>{{cite web |url=http://www.linde-gas.com/en/products_and_supply/gases_fuel/acetylene.html |title=Acetylene |accessdate=November 30, 2013 |publisher=Linde |website=Products and Supply > Fuel Gases }}</ref>  Acetylene is the third-hottest natural chemical flame after [[dicyanoacetylene]]'s {{convert|5260|K|C F}} and [[cyanogen]] at {{convert|4798|K|C F}}. [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|Oxy-acetylene welding]] was a very popular welding process in previous decades; however, the development and advantages of [[arc welding|arc-based welding processes]] have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly. On the other hand, oxy-acetylene welding ''equipment'' is quite versatile – not only because the torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications. [[Bell Canada]] cable repair technicians still use portable acetylene fuelled torch kits as a [[soldering]] tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in [[manhole]]s and in some aerial locations. Oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible. As well, oxy-fuel cutting is still very popular and oxy-acetylene cutting is utilized in nearly every metal fabrication shop. For use in welding and cutting, the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator, since above 15 psi,<ref>[http://www.c-f-c.com/specgas_products/acetylene.htm Acetylene - Properties, Purity and Packaging - Acetylene is simplest member of unsaturated hydrocarbons called alkynes or acetylenes.

===Portable lighting===
[[Calcium carbide]] was used to generate acetylene used in the lamps for portable or remote applications.  It was used for miners and cavers before the widespread use of [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent lighting]]; or many years later low-power/high-lumen LED lighting; and is still used by mining industries in some nations without workplace safety laws.  It was also used as an early light source for lighthouses. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Plastics and acrylic acid derivatives===
Acetylene can be partially [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to ethylene, providing a feedstock for a variety of [[polyethylene]] plastics. Another major application of acetylene is its conversion to [[acrylic acid]] [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]].<ref name=Ullmann/> These derivatives form products such as [[acrylic fiber]]s, [[Acrylic glass|glass]]es, [[Acrylic paint|paint]]s, [[Acrylic resin|resin]]s, and [[Acrylate polymer|polymer]]s.<ref name=Takashi />

===Niche applications===
In 1881, the Russian chemist Mikhail Kucherov<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/cber.188101401320|title=Ueber eine neue Methode direkter Addition von Wasser (Hydratation) an die Kohlenwasserstoffe der Acetylenreihe|year=1881|last1=Kutscheroff|first1=M.|journal=Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft|volume=14|pages=1540–1542}}</ref> described the [[Hydration reaction|hydration]] of acetylene to [[acetaldehyde]] using catalysts such as [[mercury(II) bromide]]. Before the advent of the [[Wacker process]], this reaction was conducted on an industrial scale.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Hydration of Acetylene: A 125th Anniversary |author1=Dmitry A.

The [[polymerization]] of acetylene with [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst]]s produces [[polyacetylene]] films. Polyacetylene, a chain of CH centres with alternating single and double bonds, was one of the first discovered [[organic semiconductor]]s. Its reaction with [[iodine]] produces a highly electrically conducting material. Although such materials are not useful, these discoveries led to the developments of [[organic semiconductor]]s, as recognized by the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2000 to [[Alan J. Heeger]], [[Alan G MacDiarmid]], and [[Hideki Shirakawa]].<ref name=Ullmann/>

In the early 20th century acetylene was widely used for illumination, including street lighting in some towns.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0AnJU-hralEC The 100 most important chemical compounds: a reference guide]</ref> Most early automobiles used [[carbide lamp]]s before the adoption of electric headlights. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Acetylene is sometimes used for [[carburization]] (that is, hardening) of steel when the object is too large to fit into a furnace.<ref name=BOC2006>{{cite web |url=http://boc.com/products_and_services/by_product/acetylene/index.asp |title=Acetylene |publisher=BOC |website=Products and Services |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517074022/http://boc.com/products_and_services/by_product/acetylene/index.asp |archivedate=17 May 2006 }}</ref>

Acetylene is used to volatilize carbon in [[radiocarbon dating]]. The carbonaceous material in an archeological sample is treated with [[lithium]] metal in a small specialized research furnace to form [[lithium carbide]] (also known as lithium acetylide). The carbide can then be reacted with water, as usual, to form acetylene gas to be fed into [[mass spectrometer]] to measure the isotopic ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Geyh, Mebus|title=Radiocarbon dating problems using acetylene as counting gas|journal=Radiocarbon|year=1990|volume=32|issue=3|pages=321–324|doi=10.2458/azu_js_rc.32.1278|url=https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/radiocarbon/article/view/1278/1283|accessdate=26 December 2013}}</ref>

==Natural occurrence==
The energy richness of the C≡C triple bond and the rather high solubility of acetylene in water make it a suitable substrate for bacteria, provided an adequate source is available {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. A number of bacteria living on acetylene have been identified. The [[enzyme]] [[acetylene hydratase]] catalyzes the hydration of acetylene to give acetaldehyde.<ref>

Since such temperatures are highly unlikely on such a small distant body, this discovery is potentially suggestive of catalytic reactions within that moon, making it a promising site to search for prebiotic chemistry.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[The Planetary Society]] |author =Emily Lakdawalla |title=LPSC: Wednesday afternoon: Cassini at Enceladus |date=17 March 2006 |url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000498/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220053655/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000498/ |archivedate=20 February 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=445 | pages=376–377| date= 25 January 2007| doi = 10.1038/445376b| title= Planetary science: Inside Enceladus|author1=John Spencer |author2=David Grinspoon |pmid=17251967|issue=7126}}</ref>

==Safety and handling==
Acetylene is not especially toxic but, when generated from [[calcium carbide]], it can contain toxic impurities such as traces of [[phosphine]] and [[arsine]], which give it a distinct garlic-like smell {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. It is also highly flammable, as most light hydrocarbons, hence its use in welding. Its most singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability, especially when it is pressurized: under certain conditions acetylene can react in an [[exothermic]] addition-type reaction to form a number of products, typically [[benzene]] and/or [[vinylacetylene]], possibly in addition to [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. Consequently, acetylene, if initiated by intense heat or a shockwave, can decompose explosively if the absolute pressure of the gas exceeds about {{convert|200|kPa|psi}}. Most regulators and pressure gauges on equipment report [[gauge pressure]] and the safe limit for acetylene therefore is 101 kPa<sub>gage</sub> or 15 psig.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.c-f-c.com/specgas_products/acetylene.htm | title = Acetylene Specification | accessdate = 2012-05-02 | publisher = CFC StarTec LLC}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/cfr/ibr/003/cga.g-1.2009.pdf|title=law.resource.org CGA g-1 2009 (incorporated by reference)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref> It is therefore supplied and stored dissolved in [[acetone]] or [[dimethylformamide]] (DMF),<ref name=":0" /><ref name='Industrial Gases'>{{cite book | last1 = Downie | first1 = N.
