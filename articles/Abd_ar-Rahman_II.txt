==Biography==
Abd ar-Rahman II was born in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the son of [[Emir]] [[Al-Hakam I]]. In his youth he took part in the so-called "massacre of the ditch", when from 700 to 5,000 people come to pay homage to the princes who were killed by order of Al-Hakam.

He succeeded his father as Emir of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in 822 and engaged in nearly continuous warfare against [[Alfonso II of Asturias]], whose southward advance he halted (822–842). 
In 837, he suppressed a revolt of [[Christians]] and [[Jew]]s in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. 
He issued a decree by which the Christians were forbidden to seek martyrdom, and he had a Christian [[synod]] held to forbid  martyrdom.

In 844, Abd ar-Rahman repulsed an assault by [[Vikings]] who had disembarked in [[Cádiz]], conquered [[Seville]] (with the exception of its citadel) and attacked Córdoba itself. 
Thereafter he constructed a fleet and naval [[arsenal]] at [[Seville]] to repel future raids.

He responded to [[William of Septimania]]'s requests of assistance in his struggle against [[Charles the Bald]]'s nominations.

Abd ar-Rahman was famous for his public building program in Córdoba where he died in 852. He made additions to the [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba]].<ref name=EB/> A vigorous and effective frontier warrior, he was also well known as a patron of the arts.<ref>{{cite book |author=Thorne, John |title=Chambers biographical dictionary |publisher=Chambers |location=Edinburgh |year=1984 |pages= |isbn=0-550-18022-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>
