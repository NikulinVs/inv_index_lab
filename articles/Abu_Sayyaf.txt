==Background and history==
In the early 1970s, the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (MNLF) was the main Muslim rebel groups fighting in Basilan and Mindanao in the southern Philippines.<ref name="TKBAbu" /> [[Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani]], the older brother of [[Khadaffy Janjalani]], had been a teacher from Basilan, who later studied Islamic [[theology]] and [[Arabic]] in Libya, [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] during the 1980s.<ref name="PacCom">{{cite web|title=Abu Sayyaf History |publisher=U.S. Pacific Command |date=21 September 2006 |url=http://www.pacom.mil/piupdates/abusayyafhist.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123213349/http://www.pacom.mil/piupdates/abusayyafhist.shtml |archivedate=23 January 2009}}</ref><ref name="BBCWho">{{cite news|title=Who are the Abu Sayyaf |date=30 December 2000 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/719623.stm | location=London}}</ref> Abdurajik then went to Afghanistan to fight against the [[Soviet Union]] and the Afghan government during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] in the 1980s. During that period, he is alleged to have met [[Osama Bin Laden]] and been given $6 million to establish a more Islamic group with the MNLF in the southern Philippines, made up of members of the extant MNLF<ref name="NBR">{{cite web|title=Funding Terrorism in Southeast Asia: The Financial Network of Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah |url=http://www.nbr.org/publications/analysis/pdf/vol14no5.pdf |publisher=The National Bureau of Asian Research |accessdate=20 September 2006|format=PDF| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060927184541/http://www.nbr.org/publications/analysis/pdf/vol14no5.pdf| archivedate= 27 September 2006 | deadurl= no}}</ref> By then, as a political solution in the southern Philippines, ARMM had been established in 1989. Both Abdurajik Abubakar and his younger brother who succeeded him were natives of [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela City]], currently one of the poorest [[cities of the Philippines]]. Located on the North-Western part of the island of Basilan, Isabela is also the capital of Basilan province, across the Isabela Channel from the Malamwi Island. But Isabela City is administered under the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] political region north of the island of Basilan, while the rest of the island province of Basilan is now (since 1996) governed as part of the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM) to the east.

===Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani leadership (1989–1998)===
MNLF had moderated into an established political government, the ARMM. It was established in 1989, fully institutionalised by 1996 and which eventually became the ruling government in southern Mindanao. When Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani returned home to Basilan island in 1990, he gathered radical members of the old MNLF who wanted to resume armed struggle for an independent Islamic state and in 1991 established the Abu Sayyaf.<ref name="TKBAbu" /> Janjalani was provided some funding by a Saudi Islamist, Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, who came to the Philippines in 1987 or 1988 and was head of the Philippine branch of the International Islamic Relief Organization foundation. A defector from Abu Sayyaf told Filipino authorities, "The IIRO was behind the construction of Mosques, school buildings and other livelihood projects" but only "in areas penetrated, highly influenced and controlled by the Abu Sayyaf." According to the defector "Only 10 to 30% of the foreign funding goes to the legitimate relief and livelihood projects and the rest go to terrorist operations".<ref name=abuza>Zachary Abuza, "[http://www.jstor.org/stable/25798639 Funding Terrorism in Southeast Asia: The Financial Network of Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah]," ''The National Bureau of Asian Research'' 14, no. 5 (December 2003): 176.</ref><ref>

By 1995 Abu Sayyaf was active in large scale bombings and attacks in the Philippines. The Abu Sayyaf's first attack was the assault on the town of [[Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay|Ipil]] in [[Mindanao]] in April 1995. This year also marked the escape of 20-year-old Khadaffy Janjalani from [[Camp Crame]] in [[Manila]] along with another member named Jovenal Bruno. On 18 December 1998, Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani was killed in a gun battle with the [[Philippine National Police]] on Basilan Island.<ref name="TimeAsiaReturn" /> He is thought to have been about age 39 at the time of his death.<ref name="BBCWho" /> The death of Aburajik Abubakar Janjalani marked a turning point in Abu Sayyaf operations, shifting from its ideological focus to more general kidnappings, murders and robberies, as the younger brother Khadaffy Janjalani succeeded Abdurajak. Consequently, being on the social or political division line, Basilan, Jolo and Sulu have seen some of the fiercest fighting between government troops and the Muslim separatist group Abu Sayyaf through the early 1990s. The Abu Sayyaf primarily operates in the southern Philippines with members travelling to [[Manila]] and other provinces in the country. It was reported that Abu Sayyaf had begun expanding into neighbouring [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] by the early 1990s. The Abu Sayyaf is one of the smallest, but strongest of the [[Islamist]] separatist groups in the Philippines. Some Abu Sayyaf members have studied or worked in [[Saudi Arabia]] and developed ties to [[mujahadeen]] while fighting and training in the war against the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].<ref name = "PacCom"/> Abu Sayyaf proclaimed themselves as [[mujahideen]] and freedom fighters but are not supported by many people in the Philippines including its Muslim [[cleric]]s.

===Khadaffy Janjalani leadership (1999–2007)===
Until his death in a gunbattle on 4 September 2006, [[Khadaffy Janjalani|Khaddafy Janjalani]] was considered the nominal leader of the group by the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]].
The 23-year-old Khadaffy Janjalani then took leadership of one of Abu Sayyaf's factions in an internecine struggle.<ref name="TimeAsiaReturn" /><ref name="BBCFresh">{{cite news|title=Fresh fighting in S Philippines |publisher=BBC |date=7 September 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5322680.stm | location=London}}</ref> He then worked to consolidate his leadership of the Abu Sayyaf, causing the group to appear inactive for a period. After Janjalani's leadership was secured, the Abu Sayyaf began a new strategy, as they proceeded to take hostages. The group's motive for kidnapping became more financial than religious during the period of Khadaffy's leadership, according to locals in the areas associated with Abu Sayyaf. The hostage money is probably the method of financing of the group.<ref name="NBR" />

The group expanded its operations to [[Malaysia]] in 2000 when it abducted foreigners from two resorts. This action was condemned by most leaders in the Islamic world.

On 13 December 2006, it was reported that Abu Sayyaf members may have been planning attacks during the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) summit in the Philippines. The group was reported to have been training alongside Jemaah Islamiyah militants. The plot was reported to have involved detonating a car bomb in Cebu City where the summit was scheduled to take place.<ref>{{cite news|title=Manila Again Denies Terror Plot Led to Postponement of Asia Summits |date=13 December 2006 |publisher=Voice of America (VoA) |url=http://voanews.com/english/2006-12-13-voa11.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://archive.is/Pdfjd |archivedate=18 October 2014 |accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref> On 27 December, the Philippine military reported that Janjalani's remains had been recovered near Patikul, in Jolo in the southern Philippines and that DNA tests had been ordered to confirm the discovery.

===Present time (2010–present)===
In a video published in the summer of 2014, senior Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon and other masked men swear their allegiance or "[[bay'ah]]" to the "[[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]]" (ISIS) caliph. "We pledge to obey him on anything which our hearts desire or not and to value him more than anyone else. We will not take any emir (leader) other than him unless we see in him any obvious act of disbelief that could be questioned by Allah in the hereafter."<ref name="IBT-9-2014">{{cite news|last1=FlorCruz|first1=Michelle|title=Philippine Terror Group Abu Sayyaf May Be Using ISIS Link For Own Agenda|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/philippine-terror-group-abu-sayyaf-may-be-using-isis-link-own-agenda-1695156|accessdate=16 May 2015|agency=International Business Times|date=25 September 2014}}</ref> For many years prior to this Islamic State's competitor, Al Qaeda, had the support of Abu Sayyaf "through various connections."<ref name="IBT-9-2014"/> Observers were sceptical of whether the pledge would lead to Abu Sayyaf becoming an ISIS outpost in Southeast Asia, or was simply a way for the group to taking advantage of the international publicity Islamic State is getting.<ref name="IBT-9-2014"/>

==Supporters and funding==
Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani's first recruits were soldiers of the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (MNLF) and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF). However, both MNLF and MILF deny having any links with Abu Sayyaf. Both officially distance themselves from Abu Sayyaf because of its attacks on civilians and its supposed profiteering. The Philippine military, however, has claimed that elements of both groups provide support to the Abu Sayyaf. The group was originally not thought to receive funding from outside sources, but intelligence reports from the United States, Indonesia and Australia have found intermittent ties to the Indonesian [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] terrorist group,<ref>{{cite news|title=Ferry bomb terror suspect held in Manila |publisher=CNN |date=30 August 2008 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/30/philippines.suspect/index.html?iref=newssearch}}</ref> and the [[Philippines|Philippine]] government considers the Abu Sayyaf as a part of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]].<ref name="TimeAsiaReturn"/> The government also notes that initial funding for ASG in the 1990s came from [[al-Qaeda]] through the brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden, [[Mohammed Jamal Khalifa]], through Islamic charities in the region.<ref name="TimeAsiaReturn">{{cite news|title=The Return of Abu Sayyaf |date=30 August 2004 |publisher=Time Asia Magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/article/0,13673,501040830-686107,00.html | first=Simon | last=Elegant}}</ref><ref name="BBCAirRebel">{{cite news|title=Air raids hit Philippines rebels |publisher=BBC |date=20 November 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4027721.stm | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=AsiaWeek: 08.31.1999 |publisher=AsiaWeek |date=31 August 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=79205&page=1&page=1 | title=The Abu Sayyaf-Al Qaeda Connection-Abu Sayyaf Terrorist Group Alleged to Have Links to Al Qaeda | publisher=abc News International | accessdate=20 December 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20091111-235574/Abu-Sayyaf-survives-US-based-Philippine-crackdown |title=Abu Sayyaf survives US-backed Philippine crackdown |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer | accessdate=11 November 2009}}</ref>

==Motivation, beliefs, targets==
Filipino Islamist guerillas such as Abu Sayyaf, have been described as "rooted in a distinct class made up of closely knit networks built through marriage of important families through socioeconomic backgrounds and family structures," according to Michael Buehler, a lecturer in comparative politics at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies. This tight-knit, familial structure provides resilience but also limits their ability to expand.<ref name="IBT-9-2014"/> The commander of the Philippines military's Western Mindanao Command Lieutenant General Rustico Guerrero, also describes Abu Sayyaf as "a local group with a local agenda."<ref name="IBT-9-2014"/> Two kidnapping victims, (Martin and [[Gracia Burnham]]) who were kept in captivity by ASG for over a year, "gently engaged their captors in theological discussion" and found Abu Sayyaf fighters to be unfamiliar with the [[Qur'an]]. They had only "a sketchy" notion of Islam, which they saw as "a set of behavioural rules, to be violated when it suited them", according to author Mark Bowden. As "[[mujahideen|holy warriors]], they were justified in kidnapping, killing and stealing. Having sex with women captives was justified by their claiming them as "wives".<ref>{{cite web|author=Bowden, Mark|title=Jihadists in Paradise|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/03/jihadists-in-paradise/305613/2/|publisher=The Atlantic|date=1 March 2007}}</ref>

Unlike the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] and [[Moro National Liberation Front]], the group is not recognised by the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], and according to author Dr [[Robert (Bob) East]], was seen as "nothing more than a criminal operation" at least prior to 2001.<ref name="east-2">{{cite book|last1=East|first1=Robert|title=Terror Truncated: The Decline of the Abu Sayyaf Group from the Crucial Year 2002|date=17 May 2015|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing.|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pzgyBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=Abu+Sayyaf+philippines+criminal&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9QpZVcypKovyoASOiYGgDw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Abu%20Sayyaf%20philippines%20criminal&f=false|accessdate=17 May 2015}}</ref> A [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] report by Jack Fellman notes the political rather than religious motivation of ASG. He quotes ASG leader Khadaffy Janjalain's statement that his brother (the former leader of ASG) was right to split from the more moderate MNLF because "up to now, nothing came out" of attempts to gain more autonomy for Moro Muslims. This suggests, Fellman believes, that ASG "is merely the latest, albeit most violent, iteration of Moro political dissatisfaction that has existed for the last several decades".<ref name="Fellman-4">{{cite web|last1=Fellman|first1=Jack|title=Abu Sayyaf Group|url=http://csis.org/files/publication/111128_Fellman_ASG_AQAMCaseStudy5.pdf|publisher=Center for Strategic International Studies|accessdate=17 May 2015|page=4}}</ref>

Most Abu Sayyaf members are also "shabu" ([[methamphetamine]]) users as been revealed from surviving hostages who saw Abu Sayyaf members taking shabu as well from military findings who found drug packets in many of the abandoned Abu Sayyaf nests that justified their motivation as [[extremism|extreme]] like criminals and terrorists than truly fighting for religion and their region future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/583221/news/nation/military-says-abu-sayyaf-members-are-shabu-users|title=(INFO FROM EX-CAPTIVES) Military says Abu Sayyaf members are shabu users|publisher=GMA News|date=29 September 2016|accessdate=3 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2016/09/30/meet-shabu-the-drug-fueling-islamic-extremism/|title=Meet ‘Shabu,’ The Drug Fueling Islamic Extremism|author=Ryan Pickrell|publisher=The Daily Caller|date=30 September 2016|accessdate=3 October 2016}}</ref> Although if one Abu Sayyaf spokesman claimed he is representing the whole group, its spokesman also lack of knowledge of the activities on other members as the group was separated into many small group with their own leader just like the MNLF as been discovered by a Malaysian journalist, who see the spokesman known as Abu Rami seems did not know the news of their fellow members deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/columnists/one-mans-meat/2016/10/01/a-peek-into-the-mind-of-abu-sayyaf-man-daily-chats-with-a-terrorist-provide-a-chilling-insight-into/|title=A peek into the mind of Abu Sayyaf man|author=Philip Golingai|publisher=The Star|date=1 October 2016|accessdate=3 October 2016}}</ref>

==Crimes and terrorism==
{{Main|Timeline of Abu Sayyaf attacks}}
Abu Sayyaf has carried out numerous [[bombing]]s, [[kidnapping]]s, assassinations, and [[extortion]] activities<ref name="banlaoi"/> in what they describe as their fight for an [[Independence|independent]] [[Islamic republic|Islamic province]] in the Philippines.<ref name="TKBAbu"/> These include the [[2000 Sipadan kidnappings]], the 2001 [[Dos Palmas kidnappings]], [[2004 SuperFerry 14 bombing]] and the [[2016 Davao City bombing]].

===Kidnappings===

Although the group has engaged in kidnapping hostages to be exchanged for ransom for many years, this means of funding grew dramatically beginning in 2014, providing funds for the group's rapid growth.<ref name="HookwayRansomTerror">{{cite news|last1=Hookway|first1=James|title=Terror Grows in Southern Philippines From Militants Linked to Islamic State Kidnappings, beheadings by Abu Sayyaf raise fears of expanding terror threat in Southeast Asia|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/terror-grows-in-southern-philippines-from-militants-linked-to-islamic-state-1479465005|accessdate=20 November 2016|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=18 November 2016}}</ref>

Jeffrey Schilling, an American citizen and Muslim convert, was held by Abu Sayyaf for 8 months after being captured while visiting a terrorist camp with his wife, Ivy Osani.

On 27 May 2001, an Abu Sayyaf raid kidnapped about 20 people from Dos Palmas, an expensive resort in Honda Bay, to the north of [[Puerto Princesa City]] on the island of [[Palawan]], which had been "considered completely safe". The most "valuable" of the hostages were three North Americans, Martin and Gracia Burnham, a [[missionary]] couple, and Guillermo Sobero, a Peruvian-American tourist who was later [[Decapitation|beheaded]] by Abu Sayyaf, for whom Abu Sayyaf demanded $1&nbsp;million in [[ransom]].<ref>[http://newsstand.blogs.com/newsstand/2007/01/turns_out_abu_s.html Gracia's enemies newsstand.blogs.com] {{dead link|date=July 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The hostages and hostage-takers then returned hundreds of kilometres back across the [[Sulu Sea]] to the Abu Sayyaf's territories in Mindanao.<ref name=Bowden2007p54>"Manhunt" by Mark Bowden, ''The Atlantic'', March 2007, p.54 (15)</ref> According to author [[Mark Bowden]], the leader of the raid was [[Abu Sabaya]]. According to [[Gracia Burnham]], she told her husband "to identify his kidnappers" to authorities "as 'the Osama bin Laden Group,' but Burnham was unfamiliar with that name and stuck with" Abu Sayyaf. After returning to Mindanao, Abu Sayyaf operatives conducted numerous raids, including one that culminated in the [[Siege of Lamitan]] and "one at a coconut plantation called Golden Harvest; they took about 15 people captive there and later used [[bolo knife|bolo knives]] to hack the heads off two men. The number of hostages waxed and waned as some were ransomed and released, new ones were taken and others were killed."<ref name=Bowden2007p54 />

On 7 June 2002, about a year after the raid, Philippine army troops conducted a rescue operation in which two of the three hostages held, Martin Burnham and Filipino nurse, Ediborah Yap, were killed. The remaining hostage was wounded and the hostage takers escaped. In July 2004, Gracia Burnham [[Testimony|testified]] at a trial of eight Abu Sayyaf members and identified six of the suspects as being her erstwhile captors, including Alhamzer Limbong, Abdul Azan Diamla, Abu Khari Moctar, Bas Ishmael, Alzen Jandul, and Dazid Baize.

A television set filled with 8&nbsp;lb. (4 kilograms) of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] had been placed on board. 90 minutes out of port, the bomb exploded. 63 people were killed instantly and 53 went missing and presumed dead. Despite claims from terrorist groups, the blast was initially thought to have been an accident caused by a gas explosion. However, after divers righted the ferry five months after it had sunk, they found evidence of a bomb blast. A man called Redendo Cain Dellosa also admitted to planting the bomb on board for Abu Sayyaf. Philippine president [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] announced on 11 October 2004 that investigators had concluded the explosion was caused by a bomb.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rommel C.
