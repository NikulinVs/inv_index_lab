Violin_Sonata_No._5_%28Beethoven%29.txt	The '''Violin Sonata No. 5''' in [[F major]], Opus 24, is a [[violin sonata]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. It is often known as the "Spring Sonata" (''Frühlingssonate''), and was published in [[1801 in music|1801]]. Its dedicatee was [[Count Moritz von Fries]], a patron to whom Beethoven also dedicated two other works of the same year—the [[String Quintet, Op. 29 (Beethoven)|C major string quintet]] and the [[Violin Sonata No. 4 (Beethoven)|fourth violin sonata]]—as well as his later [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|seventh symphony]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lvbeethoven.com/Oeuvres/ListOpus.html|title=Beethoven's music with Opus number|website=Ludwig van Beethoven's website|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>

The work is in four movements:

#''[[Allegro (music)|Allegro]]''
#''[[Adagio (music)|Adagio]] molto espressivo''
#''[[Scherzo]]: [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] molto''
#''[[Rondo]]: [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] ma non troppo''

The ''Scherzo'' and its trio are particularly brief. The entire sonata takes approximately 22 minutes to perform. The name "Spring Sonata" was given to it after Beethoven's death.

The ''Allegro'' movement is featured in the stage show ''[[Fame (musical)|Fame]]''.
