Diab, at the age of six, had his first shot at fame when he sang the Egyptian National Anthem "[[Bilady, Bilady, Bilady]]" at the annual 23 July Festival in Port Said. As a result, he was rewarded with a guitar from the governor of Port Said, and began to become recognised nationally.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Diab graduated with a bachelor's degree in Arabic Music from the Cairo Academy of Arts in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Film career ==

Diab's fame in the music industry has led him to experiment with other forms of media, such as film. Amr played himself in his first film, ''El Afareet'', which was released in 1989. It also starred Madiha Kamel. His second film ''Ice Cream in Gleam'' (''Ays Krim fi Glym''), in which Diab starred in 1992, was chosen as one of the best five Egyptian musical films by the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]]. The film was featured in the UCLA Film and Television Archive's new program "Music on the Nile: Fifty Years of Egyptian Musical Films" at James Bridges Theater at UCLA on 6, 8 and 10 April 1999. David Chute of the ''Los Angeles Weekly'' termed it "observant" and "a big leap".<ref>{{cite news |first= David |last= Chute |author2=Irene G. Behnan |title= All Singing!
