Third Edition. Ithaca, N.Y.: Spoken Language Services. p. 601.</ref>

The oldest surviving indication of an Arab national identity is an inscription made in an archaic form of Arabic in 328 using the [[Nabataean alphabet]], which refers to [[Imru' al-Qays ibn 'Amr]] as "King of all the Arabs".<ref>{{cite book |title=Recent Research on the Late Antique Countryside|author1=William Bowden |author2=Luke Lavan |author3=Carlos Machado |year=2004|page=91|publisher=Brill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFhsk-ccTsAC&pg=PA91}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Islamic Societies|author=Ira M.

The most popular Arab account holds that the word "Arab" came from an [[eponym]]ous father called [[Ya'rub]] who was supposedly the first to speak Arabic. [[Abu Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdani]] had another view; he states that Arabs were called '''Gharab''' ("West") by [[Mesopotamia]]ns because Bedouins originally resided to the west of Mesopotamia; the term was then corrupted into "Arab".

Yet another view is held by [[al-Masudi]] that the word "Arabs" was initially applied to the [[Ishmaelites]] of the "[[Arabah]]" valley. In Biblical etymology, "Arab" (in Hebrew ''Arvi'' ) comes both from the desert origin of the Bedouins it originally described (''Arava'' means wilderness).

The root ''ʿ-r-b'' has several additional meanings in Semitic languages—including "west/sunset," "desert," "mingle," "mixed," "merchant," and "raven"—and are "comprehensible" with all of these having varying degrees of relevance to the emergence of the name. It is also possible that some forms were [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathetical]] from {{transl|sem|ʿ-B-R}} "moving around" (Arabic {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ-B-R}} "traverse"), and hence, it is alleged, "nomadic."<ref>[http://uqu.edu.sa/page/ar/56829 The meaning of Arab land in the historical sources ]</ref>

==Identity==
{{Further information|Arab identity}}
Arab identity is defined independently of [[religion|religious]] identity, and pre-dates the [[spread of Islam]], with historically attested [[Arab Christians|Arab Christian]] kingdoms and [[Jewish tribes of Arabia|Arab Jewish tribes]]. Today, however, most Arabs are Muslim,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7Ao8dYsCskC&lpg=PA45&pg=PA45#v=onepage&q&f=false| title=The Arabs in Palestine|accessdate=March 4, 2014|author=Ori Stendel|page=45|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=1898723249}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PmgkD3Hel5IC&lpg=PA309&pg=PA297#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Between Heaven and Hell: Islam, Salvation, and the Fate of Others|author=Mohammad Hassan Khalil|accessdate=March 1, 2014|page=297|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> with a minority adhering to other faiths, largely [[Christianity in the Middle East|Christianity]], but also [[Druze]] and [[Bahá'í Faith|Baha'i]].

Arab ethnic identity does ''not'' include the [[Jews]], [[Samaritans]], [[Assyrian people]] of Iraq, north east Syria, north west Iran and south east Turkey, the [[Syriac Christians]] of western Syria, [[Armenians]] around the entire Near East, and [[Mandaeans]] in Iraq and Iran—though many of these peoples speak Arabic as a first or second language. Additionally, a number of other indigenous peoples living within what is considered the Arab World are equally non-Arab, even if they are ethnic groups which predominantly consist of adherents of Islam. These include ethnic groups such as [[Berbers]], [[Kurds]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Demographics of Iran|Persians/Iranians]], [[Copts]], [[Azeris]], [[Yezidi]]s, [[Circassians]], [[Shabaks]], [[Turkmen people|Turcomans]], [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Chechens]], [[Kawliya]], [[Mhallami]]. Nor does Arab include migrant groups resident in the Arab World, even if they are largely of the Muslim faith.
[[File:NE 565ad-Lakhmid.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Near East in 565, showing the Ghassanids, Lakhmids, Kindah and Hejaz.]]
Today, the main unifying characteristic among Arabs is [[Arabic]], a [[Central Semitic languages|Central Semitic language]] from the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language family]]. [[Modern Standard Arabic]] serves as the [[Standard language|standardized]] and [[literary language|literary]] variety of Arabic used in writing. The Arabs are first mentioned in the mid-ninth century BCE as a tribal people dwelling in the central Arabian Peninsula subjugated by [[Upper Mesopotamia]]-based state of Assyria. The Arabs appear to have remained largely under the vassalage of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911-605 BCE), and then the succeeding [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (605-539 BCE), Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] (539-332 BCE), [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]]/[[Seleucid Empire]] and [[Parthian Empire]].

Arab tribes, most notably the [[Ghassanids]] and [[Lakhmids]] begin to appear in the south Syrian deserts and southern Jordan from the mid 3rd century CE onwards, during the mid to later stages of the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Sasanian Empire]]. The [[Nabataeans]] of Jordan appear to have been an Aramaic speaking ethnic mix of Canaanites, Arameans and Arabs. Thus, although a more limited diffusion of Arab culture and language was felt in some areas by these migrant minority Arabs in ''pre-Islamic'' times through Arab Christian kingdoms and Arab Jewish tribes, it was only after the [[rise of Islam]] in the mid-7th century that Arab culture, people and language began their wholesale spread from the central Arabian Peninsula (including the south Syrian desert) through conquest and trade.

[[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] refers to the Arabian Peninsula prior to the rise of Islam in the 630s. Some of the settled communities in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] developed into distinctive civilizations. Sources for these civilizations are not extensive, and are limited to archaeological evidence, accounts written outside of Arabia, and Arab oral traditions later recorded by Islamic scholars. Among the most prominent civilizations were [[Thamud]], which arose around 3000 BCE and [[lasted]] to about 300 CE, and [[Dilmun]], which arose around the end of the fourth millennium and lasted to about 600 CE. Additionally, from the beginning of the first millennium BCE, [[Southern Arabia]] was the home to a number of kingdoms, such as the [[Sabaean kingdom]], and the coastal areas of [[Eastern Arabia]] were controlled by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanians]] from 300 BCE.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Nomadic Tribes of Arabia|url=https://www.boundless.com/world-history/textbooks/boundless-world-history-i-ancient-civilizations-enlightenment-textbook/the-rise-and-spread-of-islam-8/pre-islamic-arabia-42/the-nomadic-tribes-of-arabia-154-13223/|website=Boundless|language=en|date=2 October 2016}}</ref>

Arabians are most prevalent in the Arabian Peninsula, but are also found in large numbers in Mesopotamia ([[Arab tribes in Iraq]]), the Levant and Sinai ([[Negev Bedouin]], [[Tarabin bedouin]]), as well as the Maghreb (Libya, South Tunisia and South Algeria) and the Sudan region.

Arabs in the narrow sense are the indigenous Arabians (who trace their roots back to the [[tribes of Arabia]]) and their immediate descendant groups in the Levant and North Africa. Within the people of the Arabian Peninsula, distinction is made between: 
Perishing Arabs ({{lang-ar|العرب البائدة}}) are ancient tribes of whose history little is known. They include ‘Aad, [[Thamud]], Tasm, Jadis, Imlaq and others. Jadis and Tasm perished because of genocide.  'Aad and Thamud perished because of their decadence, as recorded in the Qur'an. Archaeologists have recently uncovered inscriptions that contain references to 'Iram, which was a major city of the 'Aad. Imlaq is the singular form of 'Amaleeq and is probably synonymous to the biblical [[Amalek]].
Pure Arabs or [[Qahtanites]] ({{lang|ar|العرب العاربة}}) from [[Yemen]], taken to be descended from [[Ya'rub|Ya‘rub ibn Yashjub ibn Qahtan]] and further from either [[Ishmael]] or [[Hud (prophet)|Hud]].
Arabized Arabs or [[Adnanites]] ({{lang|ar|العرب المستعربة}}), taken to be the descendants of [[Ishmael]] son of [[Abraham]].
[[File:Pre Islamic Arabia.PNG|thumb|left|Arabian tribes before the spread of Islam]]
This traditional division of the Arabs of Arabia may have arisen at the time of the [[First Fitna]]. Of the [[Arabian tribes that interacted with Muhammad]], the most prominent was the [[Quraysh]]. The Quraysh subclan, the [[Banu Hashim]], was the clan of Muhammad. During the early Muslim conquests and the [[Islamic Golden Age]], the political rulers of Islam were exclusively members of the Quraysh.

The Arab presence in Iran did not begin with the [[Arab conquest of Persia]] in 633 AD. For centuries, Iranian rulers had maintained contacts with Arabs outside their borders, dealt with Arab subjects and client states (such as those of Iraq and Yemen), and settled Arab tribesmen in various parts of the Iranian plateau. It follows that the "Arab" conquests and settlements were by no means the exclusive work of Arabs from the [[Hejaz]] and the tribesmen of inner Arabia. The Arab infiltration into Iran began before the Muslim conquests and continued as a result of the joint exertions of the civilized Arabs (ahl al-madar) as well as the desert Arabs (ahl al-wabar).<ref name=IranicaDaniel>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Daniel |first=E. L. | title= Arab settlements in Iran | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | accessdate=2011-04-09|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arab-iii}}</ref> The largest group of [[Iranian Arabs]] are the [[Ahwazi Arabs]], including [[Banu Ka'b]], [[Bani Turuf]] and the [[Musha'sha'iyyah]] sect. Smaller groups are the [[Khamseh]] nomads in [[Fars Province]] and the [[Arabs in Khorasan]].

The Arabs of the [[Levant]] are traditionally divided into [[Qays and Yaman tribes]]. This tribal division is likewise taken to date to the Umayyad period.
The Yemen trace their origin to South Arabia or [[Yemen]]; they include [[Banu Kalb]], [[Kindah]], [[Ghassanids]], and [[Lakhmids]].<ref>Hugh Kennedy ''The Armies of the Caliphs: Military and Society in the Early Islamic State'' p.33 Routledge, Jun 17, 2013 ISBN 1134531133</ref> Since the 1834 [[Peasants' revolt in Palestine]], the Arabic-speaking population of Palestine has shed its formerly tribal structure and emerged as the [[Palestinians]].

Native Jordanians are either descended from [[Bedouin]]s (of which, 6% live a nomadic lifestyle),<ref name="LowiMiriam">Lowi, Miriam R., ''Water and power: the politics of a scarce resource in the Jordan River basin'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.36</ref> or from the many deeply rooted non bedouin communities across the country, most notably [[Al-Salt]] city west of [[Amman]] which was at the time of Emirate the largest urban settlement east of the [[Jordan River]].

[[File:Léon Bonnat - An Arab Sheik - Walters 37173 (2).jpg|left|thumb|Bedouin man in Egypt, 1868.]]
The Bedouin of western Egypt and eastern Libya are traditionally divided into [[Saʿada and Murabtin]], the Saʿada having higher social status. This may derive from a historical feudal system in which the Murabtin were vassals to the Saʿada

In [[Sudan]], there are numerous Arabic-speaking tribes, including the [[Shaigya]], [[Ja'alin]] and [[Shukria tribe|Shukria]], who are ancestrally related to the [[Nubian people|Nubians]]. These groups are collectively known as [[Sudanese Arabs]]. In addition, there are other Afroasiatic-speaking populations, such as [[Copts]] and [[Beja people|Beja]].
[[File:Emir of Sidi Bel Abbes.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Commander of Annaba and Amir of Constantine, [[Banu Hilal]]]]
The medieval [[Arab slave trade]] in the Sudan drove a wedge between the Arabic-speaking groups and the indigenous [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] populations. [[Slavery in contemporary Africa|Slavery]] substantially persists today along these lines.<ref>Hall, Bruce S., ''A History of Race in Muslim West Africa, 1600-1960''. Cambridge University Press, 2011.</ref> It has contributed to ethnic conflict in the region, such as the [[Sudanese conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile]], [[Northern Mali conflict]], or the [[Boko Haram insurgency]].

The Arabs of the Maghreb are descendants of Arabian tribes of [[Banu Hilal]], the [[Banu Sulaym]] and the [[Maqil]] native of [[Middle East]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = François Decret, Les invasions hilaliennes en Ifrîqiya - Clio - Voyage Culturel|url = https://www.clio.fr/BIBLIOTHEQUE/les_invasions_hilaliennes_en_ifriqiya.asp|website = www.clio.fr|accessdate = 2015-09-28|last = Clio}}</ref> and of other tribes native to [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Yemen]] and [[Iraq]]. Arabs and [[Arabic]]-speakers inhabit plains and cities. The [[Banu Hilal]] spent almost a century in [[Egypt]] before moving to [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]], and another century later some moves to [[Morocco]], it is logical to think that they are mixed with inhabitants of [[Egypt]] and with [[Libya]].<ref>Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique septentrionale par Ibn Khaldoun</ref>

==Demographics==
The total number of Arabic speakers living in the [[Arab League|Arab nations]] is estimated at 366 million by the [[CIA Factbook]] (as of 2014). The estimated number of Arabs in countries outside the Arab League is estimated at 17.5 million, yielding a total of close to 384 million.

===Arab world===
[[File:Population Density.PNG|thumb|220px|right|Population density of the Arab world in 2008]]
According to the [[Charter of the Arab League]] (also known as the ''Pact of the League of Arab States''), the League of Arab States is composed of independent Arab states that are signatories to the Charter.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pact of the League of Arab States, March 22, 1945|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/arableag.asp|publisher=Yale Law School|accessdate=9 July 2016}}</ref>

Although all Arab states have Arabic as an official language, there are many non-Arabic-speaking populations native to the Arab world. Among these are [[Berbers]], [[Toubou people|Toubou]], [[Nubians]], [[Jews]], [[Kurds]], [[Armenians]].<ref name="Tadmouri2014">{{cite journal|author1=Ghazi O. Tadmouri |author2=Konduru S.

Iraq, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman have a Persian speaking minority. The same countries also have Hindi-Urdu speakers and [[Filipinos]] as sizable minority. Balochi speakers are a good size minority in Oman. Additionally, countries like Bahrain, UAE, Oman and Kuwait have significant non-Arab and non-Muslim minorities (10–20%) like [[Hindus]] and [[Christians]] from [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and the [[Philippines]].

=== Arab diaspora ===
{{main article|Arab diaspora|List of Arabic neighborhoods}}
[[File:The Syrian colony, Washington Street.jpg|220px|thumb|Syrian immigrants in New York City, as depicted in 1895]]
[[Arab diaspora]] refers to descendants of the [[Arab people|Arab]] [[Emigration|immigrants]] who, voluntarily or as refugees, emigrated from their native lands in non-Arab countries, primarily in [[East Africa]], [[South America]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], and parts of [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[West Africa]]. According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], there are 13 million first-generation Arab migrants in the world, of which 5.8 million reside in Arab countries. Arab expatriates contribute to the circulation of financial and human capital in the region and thus significantly promote regional development. In 2009, Arab countries received a total of 35.1 billion USD in [[remittance]] in-flows and remittances sent to [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]] from other Arab countries are 40 to 190 per cent higher than trade revenues between these and other Arab countries.<ref>[http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Intra%20regional%20labour%20mobility%20in%20Arab%20region%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf Intra-Regional Labour Mobility in the Arab World], International Organization for Migration (IOM) Cairo</ref> The 250,000 strong Lebanese community in [[West Africa]] is the largest non-African group in the region.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lebanese in west Africa: Far from home |url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2011/05/lebanese_west_africa|newspaper=The Economist|date=20 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Tenacity and risk – the Lebanese in West Africa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8479134.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=10 January 2010}}</ref> Arab traders have long operated in [[Southeast Asia]] and along the East Africa's [[Swahili coast]].

==History==

===Pre-Islamic===
{{Main article|Pre-Islamic Arabia}}
Pre-Islamic Arabia refers to Arabic civilization in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] before the rise of [[Islam]] in the 630s. The study of Pre-Islamic Arabia is important to [[Islamic studies]] as it provides the context for the development of Islam.

====Origins and early history====
{{further information|Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Proto-Arabic}}
[[File:Al-Jaahith - African Arab Naturalist - Basra - al jahiz.jpg|thumb|Arab polymath [[Al-Jahiz]]]]<!-- ancient Himyarites spoke Himyarite (not Arabic) and did not speak Arabic or have Arabian genealogical traditions -->
[[Old Arabic]] diverges from [[Central Semitic]] by the beginning of the 1st millennium BC.

The first written attestation of the ethnonym "Arab" occurs in an [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] inscription of 853 BCE, where [[Shalmaneser III]] lists a King [[Gindibu]] of ''mâtu arbâi'' (Arab land) as among the people he defeated at the [[Battle of Karkar]]. Some of the names given in these texts are [[Aramaic]], while others are the first attestations of [[Ancient North Arabian]] dialects. In fact several different ethnonyms are found in Assyrian texts that are conventionally translated "Arab": ''Arabi, Arubu, Aribi'' and ''Urbi''. Many of the [[Qedarite]] queens were also described as queens of the ''aribi''. The [[Hebrew Bible]] occasionally refers to ''Aravi'' peoples (or variants thereof), translated as "Arab" or "Arabian." The scope of the term at that early stage is unclear, but it seems to have referred to various desert-dwelling Semitic tribes in the [[Syrian Desert]] and Arabia.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Arab tribes came into conflict with the Assyrians during the reign of the Assyrian king [[Ashurbanipal]], and he records military victories against the powerful [[Qedar]] tribe among others.

[[File:NabateensRoutes.png|thumb|220px|left|Nabataean trade routes in [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]]]]
Medieval Arab [[genealogist]]s divided Arabs into three groups:
"Ancient Arabs", tribes that had vanished or been destroyed, such as [[ʿĀd]] and [[Thamud]], often mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] as examples of God's power to vanquish those who fought his prophets.
"Pure Arabs" of South Arabia, descending from [[Qahtan]]. The [[Qahtanite]]s (Qahtanis) are said to have migrated from the land of [[Yemen]] following the destruction of the [[Ma'rib Dam]] (''sadd Ma'rib'').
The "Arabized Arabs" (''mustaʿribah'') of Central Arabia ([[Najd]]) and North Arabia, descending from [[Ishmael]] the elder son of [[Abraham]], through [[Adnan]] (hence, [[Adnanites]]). The [[Book of Genesis]] narrates that [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] promised [[Hagar]] to beget from Ishmael twelve princes and turn him to a great nation.<sup>({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:20|HE}})</sup> The [[Book of Jubilees]] claims that the sons of [[Ishmael]] intermingled with the 6 sons of [[Keturah]], from [[Abraham]], and their descendants were called Arabs and [[Ishmaelites]]:
{{quote|And Ishmael and his sons, and the sons of [[Keturah]] and their sons, went together and dwelt from [[Desert of Paran|Paran]] to the entering in of [[Babylon]] in all the land towards the East facing the desert. And these mingled with each other, and their name was called Arabs, and [[Ishmaelites]].|Book of Jubilees 20:13}}

[[Ibn Khaldun]]'s ''[[Muqaddima]]'' distinguishes between sedentary Arabian Muslims who used to be [[nomad]]ic, and Bedouin nomadic Arabs of the desert. He used the term "formerly nomadic" Arabs and refers to sedentary Muslims by the region or city they lived in, as in [[Demographics of Yemen|Yemenis]].<ref name=Levity>{{cite web|url=http://www.levity.com/alchemy/islam20.html |title=Levity.com, Islam |publisher=Levity.com |accessdate=13 April 2010}}</ref> The Christians of Italy and the Crusaders preferred the term [[Saracens]] for all the Arabs and Muslims of that time.<ref name=Lionheart>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lionheart.htm |title=www.eyewitnesstohistory.com |publisher=www.eyewitnesstohistory.com |accessdate=13 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100402073536/http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lionheart.htm| archivedate= 2 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The Christians of [[Iberia]] used the term [[Moors|Moor]] to describe all the Arabs and Muslims of that time.

Muslims of [[Medina]] referred to the [[nomadic]] tribes of the deserts as the A'raab, and considered themselves sedentary, but were aware of their close racial bonds. The term "A'raab' mirrors the term Assyrians used to describe the closely related nomads they defeated in Syria. The [[Qur'an]] does not use the word ''{{transl|ar|ʿarab}}'', only the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|nisba]] adjective ''{{transl|ar|ʿarabiy}}''. The Qur'an calls itself ''{{transl|ar|ʿarabiy}}'', "Arabic", and ''{{transl|ar|Mubin}}'', "clear". The two qualities are connected for example in ayat [[Az-Zukhruf|43]].2–3, "By the ''clear'' Book: We have made it an ''Arabic'' recitation in order that you may understand". The Qur'an became regarded as the prime example of the ''{{transl|ar|al-ʿarabiyya}}'', the language of the Arabs. The term ''[[ʾiʿrāb]]'' has the same root and refers to a particularly clear and correct mode of speech. The plural noun ''{{transl|ar|ʾaʿrāb}}'' refers to the [[Bedouin]] tribes of the desert who resisted Muhammad, for example in ''[[at-Tawba]]'' 97, ''{{transl|ar|al-ʾaʿrābu ʾašaddu kufrān wanifāqān}}'' "the Bedouin are the worst in [[kufr|disbelief]] and hypocrisy".

Based on this, in early Islamic terminology, ''{{transl|ar|ʿarabiy}}'' referred to the language, and ''{{transl|ar|ʾaʿrāb}}'' to the Arab Bedouins, carrying a negative connotation due to the Qur'anic verdict just cited. But after the [[Islamic conquest]] of the eighth century, the language of the nomadic Arabs became regarded as the most pure by the grammarians following [[Abi Ishaq]], and the term {{transl|ar|kalam al-ʿArab}}, "language of the Arabs", denoted the uncontaminated language of the Bedouins.

====Classical kingdoms====
{{main article|Palmyra|Nabateans}}
[[File:Petra , Al-Khazneh 2.jpg|thumb|220px|Facade of [[Al Khazneh]] in [[Petra]], Jordan, built by the [[Nabateans]]]]
Proto-Arabic, or [[Ancient North Arabian]], texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs' emergence. The earliest are written in variants of [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraphic]] south Arabian ''[[South Arabian alphabet|musnad]]'' script, including the 8th century BCE [[Al-Hasa|Hasaean]] inscriptions of eastern Saudi Arabia, the 6th century BCE [[Lihyanite]] texts of southeastern Saudi Arabia and the [[Thamudic]] texts found throughout Arabia and the [[Sinai]] (not in reality connected with [[Thamud]]).

The [[Nabataeans]] were nomadic newcomers{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} who moved into territory vacated by the [[Edomites]]&nbsp;– Semites who settled the region centuries before them. Their early inscriptions were in [[Aramaic]], but gradually switched to Arabic, and since they had writing, it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic. The [[Nabataean alphabet]] was adopted by Arabs to the south, and evolved into modern Arabic script around the 4th century. This is attested by [[Safaitic]] inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BCE) and the many Arabic personal names in [[Nabataean]] inscriptions. From about the 2nd century BCE, a few inscriptions from Qaryat al-Faw (near [[Sulayyil]]) reveal a dialect no longer considered ''proto-Arabic'', but ''pre-classical Arabic''. Five [[Syriac language|Syriac]] inscriptions mentioning Arabs have been found at [[Sumatar Harabesi]], one of which dates to the 2nd century CE.

====Late kingdoms====
{{Further information|Lakhmids|Ghassanids|Kindites}}
[[File:NE 565ad.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Near East in 565, showing the Lakhmids and their neighbors.]]
The Ghassanids, Lakhmids and Kindites were the last major migration of pre-Islamic Arabs out of Yemen to the north.
The Ghassanids increased the Semitic presence in the then Hellenized [[Syria (Byzantine province)|Syria]], the majority of Semites were Aramaic peoples. They mainly settled in the [[Hauran]] region and spread to modern [[Lebanon]], Palestine and East Jordan.

[[Greeks]] and Romans referred to all the nomadic population of the desert in the Near East as Arabi. The Romans called Yemen "[[Arabia Felix]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Dionysius Periegetes|url=http://www.cartographic-images.net/Cartographic_Images/117_Dionysius_Periegetes.html|website=www.cartographic-images.net}}</ref> The Romans called the vassal nomadic states within the [[Roman Empire]] "[[Arabia Petraea]]" after the city of [[Petra]], and called unconquered deserts bordering the empire to the south and east [[Arabia Magna]].
The [[Lakhmids]] as a dynasty inherited their power from the [[Tanukh]]ids, the mid Tigris region around their capital [[Al-Hira]]. They ended up allying with the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]] against the Ghassanids and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Lakhmids contested control of the Central Arabian tribes with the Kindites with the Lakhmids eventually destroying [[Kindah|Kinda]] in 540 after the fall of their main ally [[Himyar]]. The [[Persian people|Persian]] Sassanids dissolved the Lakhmid dynasty in 602, being under puppet kings, then under their direct control.<ref>Harold Bailey [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ko_RafMSGLkC&pg=PR59 The Cambridge history of Iran: The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods], Volume 1, Cambridge University Press, 1983, ISBN 0-521-20092-X p. 59</ref>
The Kindites migrated from Yemen along with the Ghassanids and Lakhmids, but were turned back in Bahrain by the Abdul Qais Rabi'a tribe. They returned to Yemen and allied themselves with the Himyarites who installed them as a vassal kingdom that ruled Central Arbia from "Qaryah Dhat Kahl" (the present-day called Qaryat al-Faw) in Central Arabia. They ruled much of the Northern/Central Arabian peninsula, until they were destroyed by the Lakhmid king [[Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man|Al-Mundhir]], and his son [['Amr III ibn al-Mundhir|'Amr]]

====Arab Caliphate====

=====Rashidun Era (632-661)=====
{{main article|Rashidun Caliphate}}
After the death of [[Muhammad]] in 632, [[Rashidun army|Rashidun armies]] launched campaigns of conquest, establishing the [[Caliphate]], or Islamic Empire, one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. It was larger and lasted longer than the previous Arab empires of [[Mavia (queen)|Queen Mawia]] or the [[Palmyrene Empire]], which was predominantly [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]] rather than Arab. The Rashidun state was a completely new state and not a mere imitation of the earlier Arab kingdoms such as the [[Himyarite]], Lakhmids or Ghassanids, although it benefited greatly from their art, administration and architecture.

=====Umayyad Era (661-750)=====
{{main article|Umayyad Caliphate}}

In 661, the Caliphate fell into the hands of the Umayyad dynasty and [[Damascus]] was established as the [[Muslim]] capital. They were proud of their Arab ancestry and sponsored the poetry and culture of pre-Islamic Arabia. They established garrison towns at [[Ramla]], [[ar-Raqqah]], [[Basra]], [[Kufa]], [[Mosul]] and [[Samarra]], all of which developed into major cities.<ref name="Lunde">{{Cite book|last=Lunde |first=Paul |title=Islam |year=2002 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Publishing |pages= 50–52 |location=New York |isbn=0-7894-8797-7 }}</ref>

[[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] established Arabic as the Caliphate's official language in 686.<ref>John Joseph Saunders, ''A history of medieval Islam'', Routledge, 1965, page 13</ref> This reform greatly influenced the conquered non-Arab peoples and fueled the [[Arabization]] of the region. However, the Arabs' higher status among non-Arab Muslim converts and the latter's obligation to pay heavy taxes caused resentment. Caliph [[Umar II]] strove to resolve the conflict when he came to power in 717. He rectified the disparity, demanding that all Muslims be treated as equals, but his intended reforms did not take effect, as he died after only three years of rule. By now, discontent with the Umayyads swept the region and an uprising occurred in which the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]s came to power and moved the capital to [[Baghdad]].
[[File:Alhambra view.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Alhambra]] from the Mirador de San Nicolás in the Albaycin of Granada]]
Umayyads expanded their Empire westwards capturing North Africa from the Byzantines. Before the Arab conquest, North Africa was inhibited by various people including [[Punics]], Vandals and Greeks. It was not until the 11th century that the [[Maghreb]] saw a large influx of ethnic Arabs. Starting with the 11th century, the Arab bedouin [[Banu Hilal]] tribes migrated to the West. Having been sent by the [[Fatimids]] to punish the Berber [[Zirids]] for abandoning [[Shia Islam|Shias]], they travelled westwards.

The Banu Hilal quickly defeated the Zirids and deeply weakened the neighboring [[Hammadid]]s. Their influx was a major factor in the Arabization of the Maghreb. Although Berbers ruled the region until the 16th century (under such powerful dynasties as the [[Almoravids]], the [[Almohads]], [[Hafsids]], etc.), the arrival of these tribes eventually helped Arabize much of it ethnically, in addition to the linguistic and political impact local non-Arabs. With the collapse of the Umayyad state in 1031 AD, [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] was divided into small kingdoms.

=====Abbassid Era (750-1513)=====
{{main article|Abbasid Caliphate}}
[[File:Mustansiriya University CPT.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Mustansiriya University]] in [[Baghdad]].]]
The Abbasids led a revolt against the Umayyads and defeated them in the [[Battle of the Zab]] effectively ending their rule in all part of the Empire except [[Al-Andalus]]. The Abbasids were descendants of Muhammad's uncle [[‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|Abbas]], but unlike the Umayyads they had the support of non-Arab subjects of the Umayyads.<ref name="Lunde"/> The Abbasids ruled for 200 years before they lost their central control when [[Wilayah|Wilayas]] began to fracture; afterwards, in the 1190s, there was a revival of their power, which was ended by the Mongols, who conquered Baghdad and killed the Caliph. Members of the Abbasid royal family escaped the massacre and resorted to Cairo, which had broken from the Abbasid rule two years earlier; the Mamluk generals taking the political side of the kingdom while Abbasid Caliphs were engaged in civil activities and continued patronizing science, arts and literature.

====Golden Age of Islam====
[[File:Al-Idrisi's world map.JPG|thumb|Introductory summary overview map from [[al-Idrisi]]'s 1154 world atlas (note that [[South]] is at the top of the map).]]
The [[Islamic Golden Age]] was inaugurated by the middle of the 8th century by the ascension of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and the transfer of the capital from [[Damascus]] to the newly founded city [[Baghdad]]. The Abbassids were influenced by the [[Qur'an]]ic injunctions and [[hadith]] such as "The ink of the scholar is more holy than the blood of martyrs" stressing the value of knowledge. During this period the [[Muslim world]] became an intellectual centre for science, philosophy, medicine and education as the Abbasids championed the cause of knowledge and established the "[[House of Wisdom]]" (Arabic: بيت الحكمة) in Baghdad. Rival Muslim dynasties such as the [[Fatimid]]s of [[Egypt]] and the [[Umayyad]]s of [[al-Andalus]] were also major intellectual centres with cities such as [[Cairo]] and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] rivaling [[Baghdad]].<ref name="Vartan">Vartan Gregorian, "Islam: A Mosaic, Not a Monolith", Brookings Institution Press, 2003, pg 26–38 ISBN 0-8157-3283-X</ref>

====Ottoman Empire====
{{Main article|Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Caliphate}}
[[File:030Arab.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers of the [[Arab Army]] in the [[Arabian Desert]] carrying the [[Flag of the Arab Revolt]].]]
From 1516 to 1918, much of the Arab world was under the suzerainty of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in Cairo, and ended the Abbasid Caliphate. Arabs did not feel the change of administration because the Ottomans modeled their rule after the previous Arab administration systems.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} After [[World War I]] when the [[Ottoman Empire]] was overthrown by the [[British Empire]], former Ottoman colonies were divided up between the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] as [[League of Nations mandate]]s.

===Modern===
Arabs in modern times live in the Arab world, which comprises 22 countries in Western Asia, North Africa, and parts of the Horn of Africa. They are all modern states and became significant as distinct political entities after the fall and [[defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire (1908–1922)]].

==Culture==
{{main article|Arabic culture}}
{{Arab culture}}[[Arabic culture]] is the culture of Arab people, from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west to the [[Arabian Sea]] in the east, and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. [[Language]], [[literature]], [[gastronomy]], [[art]], [[architecture]], [[music]], [[spirituality]], [[philosophy]], [[mysticism]] (etc.) are all part of the cultural heritage of the Arabs. The Arab world is sometimes divided into separate regions including [[Nile|Nile Valley]] (consisting of Egypt and Sudan), [[Maghreb|Al-Maghrib Al-Arabi]] "the Arab West" (consisting of Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania), [[Mashriq|Al-Mashreq Al-Arabi]] "the Arab East" (consisting of Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Jordan) and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] (consisting of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, [[Khuzestan Province|Al Ahwaz Al Arabiya]],  Oman and the [[United Arab Emirates]]) and the Arabian Peninsula's [[South Arabia|Al-Janoub Al-Arabi]] "the Arab South" (consisting of Yemen and Oman). All Arabs share [[basic belief]]s and [[values]] that cross national and [[social]] class boundaries. Social attitudes have remained constant because Arab society is more conservative and demands conformity from its members. It is important for Western observers to be able to identify and distinguish these cultural patterns from individual behaviors.<ref>{{cite web|title=ARAB CUSTOMS AND CULTURE|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0I3as1WB1Q8J:www.higginsctc.org/terrorism/ARABCUSTOMSANDCUL.rtf+&cd=33&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us|website=webcache.googleusercontent.com}}</ref>

[[Classical Arabic]] is the form of the [[Arabic language]] used in literary texts from [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] times (7th to 9th centuries). It is based on the medieval dialects of [[Tribes of Arabia|Arab tribes]]. [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA) is the direct descendant used today throughout the [[Arab world]] in writing and in formal speaking, for example, prepared speeches, some radio broadcasts, and non-entertainment content,{{sfn|Bin-Muqbil|2006|p=14}} while the [[Lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] and [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] of [[Modern Standard Arabic]] are different from [[Classical Arabic]].

The three main regions, also known as the [[Maghreb]], the [[Mashriq]], and the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Khaleej]] have many similarities, but also many unique traditions. These kitchens have been influenced by the climate, cultivating possibilities, as well as trading possibilities. The kitchens of the Maghreb and [[Levant]] are relatively young kitchens which were developed over the past centuries. The kitchen from the Khaleej region is a very old kitchen. The kitchens can be divided into the [[Urban area|urban]] and [[Rural area|rural]] kitchens. [[Arab cuisine]] mostly follows one of three culinary traditions – from the Maghreb, the Levant  or the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf]]. In the Maghreb countries ([[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]]) traditional main meals are [[tajine]]s or dishes using [[couscous]]. In the [[Levant]] ([[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]) main meals usually start with [[Meze|mezze]] – small dishes of dips and other items which are eaten with bread.

[[Arabic art]] takes on many forms, though it is [[jewelry]], [[textile]]s and [[architecture]] that are the most well-known. It is generally split up by different eras, among them being [[History of the Arabic alphabet|early Arabic]], [[early medieval]], [[late medieval]], [[Arabic|late Arabic]], and finally, current Arabic. One thing to remember is that many times a particular style from one era may continue into the next with few changes, while some have a drastic transformation. This may seem like a strange grouping of art mediums, but they are all closely related. Arabic writing is done from right to left, and was generally written in dark inks, with certain things embellished with special colored inks (red, green, gold). In early Arabic and [[Early Middle Ages|early Medieval]], writing was typically done on parchment made of animal skin. The ink showed up very well on it, and occasionally the parchment was dyed a separate color and brighter ink was used (this was only for special projects). The name given to the form of writing in early times was called [[Kufic]] script.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief History on Arabic Art: Different Forms of Arabic Artworks Outlined|url=http://www.brighthubeducation.com/history-homework-help/115127-arabic-art-and-architecture-brief-history/|website=Bright Hub Education}}</ref> [[Arabic miniature]]s are small [[painting]]s on [[paper]], whether book illustrations or separate works of art.

By the 1970s several other singers had followed suit and a strand of [[Arabic pop]] was born. Arabic pop usually consists of Western styled songs with Arabic instruments and lyrics.

[[Image:AverroesColor.jpg|thumb|[[Averroes]], founder of the [[Averroism]] school of philosophy, was influential in the rise of [[Secularism|secular thought]] in [[Western Europe]].]]
[[Arabic Philosophy|Arabic philosophy]] refers to philosophical thought in the Arab world. schools of Arabic thought, including [[Avicennism]] and [[Averroism]]. The first great Arab thinker is widely regarded to be [[al-Kindi]] (801-873 A.D.), a [[Neo-Platonic]] philosopher, [[mathematician]] and [[scientist]] who lived in [[Kufa]] and [[Baghdad]] (modern day [[Iraq]]). After being appointed by the [[Abbasid Caliphs]] to translate [[Greeks|Greek]] scientific and [[philosophical]] texts into [[Arabic]], he wrote a number of original treatises of his own on a range of subjects, from [[metaphysics]] and [[ethic]]s to [[mathematic]]s and [[pharmacology]]. Much of his [[Philosophy|philosophical]] output focuses on [[Theology|theological]] subjects such as the nature of [[God]], the [[soul]] and [[Prophecy|prophetic]] knowledge.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arabic Philosophy - General - The Basics of Philosophy|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/general_eastern_arabic.html|website=www.philosophybasics.com}}</ref> Doctrines of the Arabic philosophers of the 9th–12th century who influenced medieval [[Scholasticism]] in [[Europe]]. The Arabic tradition combines [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] with other ideas introduced through [[Islam]]. Influential thinkers include the Persians [[al-Kindi]], [[al-Farabi]], and [[Avicenna]]. The Arabic philosophic literature was translated into [[Hebrew]] and [[Latin]], this contributed to the development of modern European philosophy.

[[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Arabic science]] underwent remarkable development during the 8th to 13th centuries C.E., a flowering of knowledge and intellect that later spread throughout [[Europe]] and greatly influenced both medical practice and education. The scientific glory of the [[Arab nationalism|Arabic nation]] originated on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] in the 7th century C.E., where the preaching of the prophet [[Muhammad|Mohammed]] united the [[Tribes of Arabia|Arab tribes]] and inaugurated the Muslim religion. The Arabic state was formed in 622 C.E., when the Prophet moved from [[Mecca]] to [[Medina]]. Within a century after his death (632 C.E.) a large part of the planet, from southern Europe throughout [[North Africa]] to [[Central Asia]] and on to [[India]], was controlled by and/or influenced by the new [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]]. In 711 C.E., [[Arab Muslims]] invaded southern Spain and a center of flourishing civilization ([[al-Andalus]]) was created. Another center emerged in [[Baghdad]] from the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], who ruled part of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] during a historic period later characterized as the "[[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]]" (∼750 to 1258 C.E.). This era can be identified as the years between 692 and 945,<ref name="World Civilization Vol 1 1974, pg. 234">[[Marshall Hodgson]], ''The Venture of Islam; Conscience and History in a World Civilisation Vol 1''. [[The University of Chicago]], 1974, pg. 234.</ref> and ended when the caliphate was marginalised by local Muslim rulers in Baghdad&nbsp;– its traditional seat of power. From 945 onward until the [[Sack of Baghdad|sacking of Baghdad]] by the [[Mongol invasions|Mongols]] in 1258, the Caliph continued on as a figurehead, with power devolving more to local [[amir]]s.<ref name="World Civilization Vol 1 1974, pg. 233">[[Marshall Hodgson]], ''The Venture of Islam; Conscience and History in a World Civilisation Vol 1''.

[[File:Tatouage au Henné , Maroc.JPG|thumb|[[Henna]] tattoo in [[Morocco]]]]
[[Arabic wedding]]s have changed greatly in the past 100 years. Original traditional Arabic weddings are supposed to be very similar to modern-day [[Bedouin]] weddings and rural weddings, and they are in some cases unique from one region to another, even within the same [[Arab world|country]]. it must be mentioned that what some people today call "Bedouin" wedding is in fact the original true traditional Arab Islamic wedding without foreign influence. The practice of [[Marriage|marrying]] of relatives is a common feature of [[Arab culture]]. Among Arabs the practice of marrying of relatives is a common feature. In the [[Arab world]] today between 40% and 50% of all marriages are [[consanguineous]] or between close family members, though these figures may vary among Arab nations.<ref>[http://www.middleeasthealthmag.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?http://www.middleeasthealthmag.com/may2012/feature2.htm Centre for Arabic Genomic Research]</ref><ref name="pmid24294299">{{cite journal |vauthors=Bener A, Dafeeah EE, Samson N |title=Does consanguinity increase the risk of schizophrenia?

There are four principal West Eurasian autosomal DNA components that characterize the populations in the Arab world: the Arabian, Levantine, Coptic and Maghrebi components.

The Arabian component is the main autosomal element in the [[Gulf region]]. It is most closely associated with local Arabic-speaking populations.<ref name="Haber2013"/> The Arabian component is also found at significant frequencies in parts of the Levant and Northeast Africa.<ref name=Haber2013/><ref name=Henn2012>{{cite journal|author1=Brenna M.

The Levantine component is the main autosomal element in the [[Near East]] and [[Caucasus]]. It peaks among [[Druze people|Druze]] populations in the Levant. The Levantine component diverged from the Arabian component about 15,500-23,700 ypb.<ref name=Haber2013/>

The Coptic component is the main autosomal element in [[Northeast Africa]]. It peaks among [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[Copts]] in [[Sudan]], and is also found at high frequencies among other Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the [[Nile Valley]] and [[Horn of Africa]].<ref name=Dobon2015>{{cite journal|author1=Begoña Dobon |author2=Hisham Y.
