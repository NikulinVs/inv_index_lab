'''''Alarums and Excursions''''' ('''''A&E''''') is an [[amateur press association]] started in June 1975 by [[Lee Gold]] (at the request of [[Bruce Pelz]], who felt that discussion of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' was taking up too much space in APA-L, the APA of Los Angeles's SF Fandom, usually collated at the [[Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society]]).<ref>[http://www.arielarchives.com/Brett/magazines/alarumsandexcursions.html Bretts RPG Magazine and Zine Index] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024220743/http://www.arielarchives.com/Brett/magazines/alarumsandexcursions.html |date=October 24, 2006 }}, entry on Alarums & Excursions, retrieved September 2007</ref> It was the first publication to focus solely on [[role-playing game]]s.

Each issue is a collection of contributions from different authors, often featuring game design discussions, rules variants, write-ups of game sessions, reviews, and comments on others contributions. It was a four-time winner of the [[Charles Roberts Award|Charles Roberts]]/[[Origins Award]], winning "Best Amateur Adventure Gaming Magazine" in 1984,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gama.org/OriginsAwards/OriginsAwardsWinnersThe1980s/The1984OriginsAwards/tabid/3227/Default.aspx|title=The 1984 Origins Awards - Presented ad Origins 1985|publisher=GAMA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007022304/http://www.gama.org/OriginsAwards/OriginsAwardsWinnersThe1980s/The1984OriginsAwards/tabid/3227/Default.aspx|archivedate=7 October 2014|access-date=22 April 2016}}</ref> "Best Amateur Game Magazine" in 1999,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gama.org/OriginsAwards/OriginsAwardsWinnersThe1990s/The1999OriginsAwards/tabid/3243/Default.aspx|title=The 1999 Origins Awards - Presented ad Origins 2000|publisher=GAMA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006174818/http://www.gama.org/OriginsAwards/OriginsAwardsWinnersThe1990s/The1999OriginsAwards/tabid/3243/Default.aspx|archivedate=6 October 2014|access-date=22 April 2016}}</ref> and "Best Amateur Game Periodical" in 2000<ref name = "hbdhyg">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gama.org/OriginsAwards/OriginsAwardsWinnersThe2000s/The2000OriginsAwards/tabid/3245/Default.aspx|title=The 2000 Origins Awards - Presented ad Origins 2001|publisher=GAMA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007005721/http://www.gama.org/OriginsAwards/OriginsAwardsWinnersThe2000s/The2000OriginsAwards/tabid/3245/Default.aspx|archivedate=7 October 2014|access-date=22 April 2016}}</ref> and 2001.<ref name = "hbdhyg"/>

Although game reports and social reactions are common parts of many ''A&E'' contributions, it has also, over the years, become a testing ground for new ideas on the development of the RPG as a genre and an art form. The idea that role-playing games ''are'' an art form took strong root in this zine, and left a lasting impression on many of the RPG professionals who contributed.

The July 2013 collation of ''Alarums and Excursions'' was #466.
