'''Abdera''' ({{lang|grc|τὰ Ἄβδηρα}}, [[Strabo]]; {{lang|grc|Ἄβδαρα}}, [[Ptolemy|Ptol.]]; {{lang|grc|τὸ Ἄβδηρον}}, Ephor. ap. [[Stephanus of Byzantium|Steph. B.]]) was an ancient seaport town on the south coast of [[Spain]], between Malaca (now [[Málaga]]) and [[Carthago Nova]] (now [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]), in the district inhabited by the [[Bastuli]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abdera (Spain)|display=Abdera|volume=1|page=33}}</ref>

It was founded by the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] as a trading station, and after a period of decline became under the Romans one of the more important towns in the province of [[Hispania Baetica]]. It was situated on a hill above the modern [[Adra, Spain|Adra]].<ref name="EB1911"/>

Of its coins, the most ancient bear the [[Phoenicia]]n inscription ''abdrt'' with the head of [[Melkart]] and a [[tuna|tunny-fish]]; those of [[Tiberius]] (who seems to have made the place a [[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]) show the chief temple of the town with two erect tunny fish in the form of columns.<ref name="EB1911"/> Earlier Roman coins were bilingual: Latin inscriptions on one side, stating the name of the emperor and the town and a Phoenician ethnic on the other side, simply stating the name of the town (''<nowiki/>'bdrt'').{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}
