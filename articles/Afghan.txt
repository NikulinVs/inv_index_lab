==Afghani==
The term "Afghani" refers to the unit of [[Afghan afghani|Afghan currency]]. It is often improperly used for a person or thing related to Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|title=More on Afghani|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2001/10/more_on_afghani.html |publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}</ref> The incorrect use of the term may have originated during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] when millions of Afghans took refuge in neighboring [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]]. The Afghani was created in 1925. Between 1925 and 1993 varieties of Afghani coins and banknotes were in circulation through Afghanistan. Coins issued during this period consisted of: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25 [[Pul (coin)|pul]] in bronze, brass, copper nickel, and aluminum-bronze; silver ½, 1, and 2½ Afghani; and gold ½, 1, and 2½ amani. Banknotes issued were in: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000, and 10,000 Afghani. In 1958 bank notes worth 2 and 5 were switched with coins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://famouswonders.com/afghan-afghani/|title=Afghan Afghani|work=famouswonders.com}}</ref>
