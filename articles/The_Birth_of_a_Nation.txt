'''''The Birth of a Nation''''' (originally called '''''The Clansman''''') is a 1915 American [[Silent film|silent]] [[Epic film|epic]] [[drama film]] directed and co-produced by [[D. W. Griffith]] and starring [[Lillian Gish]]. The screenplay is adapted from the novel and play ''[[The Clansman]]'', both by [[Thomas Dixon Jr.]] Griffith co-wrote the screenplay (with [[Frank E. Woods]]), and co-produced the film (with Harry Aitken). It was released on February 8, 1915.

Victoria, BC, Canada: FriesenPress. p. 1. ISBN 9781460236536.</ref> the film was originally presented in two parts separated by an intermission; it was the first 12-reel film in America. The film chronicles the relationship of two families in the [[American Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era over the course of several years: the pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[Northern United States|Northern]] Stonemans and the pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] [[Southern United States|Southern]] Camerons. The [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] by [[John Wilkes Booth]] is dramatized.

The film was a commercial success, though it was highly controversial for its portrayal of black men (some played by [[White people|white]] actors in [[blackface]]) as unintelligent and sexually aggressive towards white women, and the portrayal of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) (whose original founding is dramatized) as a heroic force.<ref>[http://www.moviejustice.com/vault/index.php?p=getitem&db_id=4&item_id=27 MJ Movie Reviews – Birth of a Nation, The (1915) by Dan DeVore]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707194449/http://www.moviejustice.com/vault/index.php?p=getitem&db_id=4&item_id=27 |date=July 7, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://themovingarts.com/revered-and-reviled-d-w-griffiths-the-birth-of-a-nation/|first=Eric M.|last=Armstrong|title=Revered and Reviled: D.W.

==Plot==

===Part 1: Civil War of United States===
The film follows two juxtaposed families. One is the Northern Stonemans: [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] U.S. Representative Austin Stoneman (based on the Reconstruction-era Representative [[Thaddeus Stevens]]<ref>...(the) portrayal of "Austin Stoneman" (bald, clubfoot; mulatta mistress, etc.) made no mistaking that, of course, Stoneman was Thaddeus Stevens..."

The other is the Southern Camerons: Dr. Cameron, his wife, their two daughters, and three sons.

The Stoneman brothers visit the Cameron estate in [[South Carolina]], representing the [[Old South]]. Phil, the elder Stoneman son, falls in love with Margaret Cameron, while young Ben Cameron idolizes a picture of Elsie Stoneman. When the Civil War begins, these young men enlist in their respective armies.

Black militiamen under a white leader ransack the Cameron house; the Cameron women are rescued by Confederate soldiers who rout the militia. Meanwhile, the younger Stoneman and two of the Cameron brothers are killed in the war. Ben Cameron leads a heroic charge at the [[Siege of Petersburg]], earning the nickname of "the Little Colonel". But he is also wounded and captured, and is taken to a Union hospital in Washington, D.C. There he meets Elsie Stoneman, whose picture he has been carrying; she is working there as a nurse. While recovering, Cameron is told that he will be hanged for being a Confederate guerrilla. Elsie takes Cameron's mother, who had traveled to Washington to tend her son, to see [[Abraham Lincoln]], and Mrs. Cameron persuades the President to pardon Ben.

When [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln is assassinated]] at [[Ford's Theater]], his conciliatory postwar policy expires with him. In the wake of the president's death, Austin Stoneman and his fellow [[Radical Republicans]] are determined to punish the South, employing harsh measures that Griffith depicts as having been typical of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]].<ref>Griffith followed the then-dominant [[Dunning School]] or "Tragic Era" view of Reconstruction presented by early 20th-century historians such as [[William Archibald Dunning]] and [[Claude G. Bowers]]. {{harvnb|Stokes|2007|pp=190–191}}.</ref>

===Part 2: Reconstruction===
Stoneman and his protégé Silas Lynch, a [[mulatto]] exhibiting psychopathic characteristics,<ref>{{cite journal  | last1 = Leistedt | first1 = Samuel J. | last2 = Linkowski | first2 = Paul | title = Psychopathy and the Cinema: Fact or Fiction? | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | date = January 2014 | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 167–174 | publisher = American Academy of Forensic Sciences | doi = 10.1111/1556-4029.12359 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.12359/abstract | accessdate = January 17, 2014 | ref = harv | pmid=24329037}}</ref> travel to South Carolina to observe the implementation of Reconstruction policies firsthand. Black occupation soldiers are seen parading through the streets and pushing white residents aside on the sidewalks. During the election, in which Lynch is elected lieutenant governor, whites are seen being prevented from voting while blacks are observed stuffing the ballot boxes. The newly elected, mostly black members of the South Carolina legislature are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up on his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on stereotypically African American fare such as fried chicken. The legislature passes laws requiring white civilians to salute black soldiers and allowing mixed-race marriages.

Meanwhile, inspired by observing white children pretending to be ghosts to scare black children, Ben fights back by forming the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, Elsie, out of loyalty to her father, breaks off her relationship with Ben. Later, Flora Cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by Gus, a freedman and soldier who is now a captain. He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he does, she leaps to her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, lynches him, and delivers his corpse to Lt. Gov. Lynch's doorstep.

Lynch then orders a crackdown on the Klan. Dr. Cameron, Ben's father, is arrested for possessing Ben's Klan regalia, now considered a crime punishable by death. His faithful black servants rescue him with help from Phil Stoneman. Together they flee, along with Margaret Cameron. When their wagon breaks down, they make their way through the woods to a small hut that is home to two sympathetic former Union soldiers who agree to hide them.  As an intertitle states, "The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their [[Aryan]] birthright."

Congressman Stoneman leaves to avoid being connected with Lt. Gov. Lynch's crackdown. Elsie, learning of Dr. Cameron's arrest, goes to Lynch to plead for his release. Lynch, who had been lusting after Elsie, tries to force her to marry him, which causes her to faint. Stoneman returns, causing Elsie to be placed in another room.  At first, Stoneman is happy when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but is then angered when Lynch tells him that it is Stoneman's daughter. Undercover Klansmen spies discover Elsie's plight when she breaks a window and cries out for help, and the Klansmen go to get help. Elsie falls unconscious again, and revives while gagged and being bound. The Klan, gathered together at full strength and with Ben leading them, rides in to regain control of the town. When news about Elsie reaches Ben, he and others go to her rescue. Elsie frees her mouth and screams for help. Lynch is captured. Victorious, the Klansmen celebrate in the streets. Meanwhile, Lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding. The Klansmen, with Ben at their head, race in to save them just in time.

The next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed Klansmen just outside their homes, and are intimidated into not voting. The film concludes with a double wedding as Margaret Cameron marries Phil Stoneman and Elsie Stoneman marries Ben Cameron. The masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. The scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of [[Jesus Christ]]. The penultimate title rhetorically asks: "Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more? But instead — the gentle Prince in the Hall of Brotherly Love in the City of Peace."

''The Birth of a Nation'' began [[Principal photography|filming]] in 1914 and pioneered such camera techniques as close-ups, fade-outs, and a carefully staged battle sequence with hundreds of extras made to look like thousands.<ref>{{cite book | last = Norton | first = Mary Beth | title = A People and a Nation, Volume II: Since 1865, Brief Edition|year= 2015|page= 487 | publisher = Cengage Learning| isbn= 1305142780}}</ref> It also contained many new artistic techniques, such as color tinting for dramatic purposes, building up the plot to an exciting climax, dramatizing history alongside fiction, and featuring its own musical score written for an orchestra.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The film was based on [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.]]'s novels ''[[The Clansman]]'' and ''[[The Leopard's Spots]]''. It was originally to have been shot in [[Kinemacolor]] but [[D. W. Griffith]] took over the Hollywood studio of Kinemacolor and Kinemacolor's plans to film Dixon's novel. Griffith, whose father served as a colonel in the [[Confederate Army]], agreed to pay Thomas Dixon $10,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1914}}}} today) for the rights to his play ''The Clansman''. Since he ran out of money and could afford only $2,500 of the original option, Griffith offered Dixon 25 percent interest in the picture. Dixon reluctantly agreed, and the unprecedented success of the film made him rich. Dixon's proceeds were the largest sum any author had received for a motion picture story and amounted to several million dollars.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Griffith's budget started at US$40,000{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40000|1915|r=-4}}}} today) but rose to over $100,000<ref name="Hall & Neale (2010)">{{Cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Sheldon |last2=Neale |first2=Stephen |title=Epics, spectacles, and blockbusters: a Hollywood history |series=Contemporary Approaches to Film and Television |year=2010 |publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]] |isbn=9780814336977 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ro0hASPfC68C&pg=PA270&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false 270] (note 2.78)|quote=In common with most film historians, he estimates that ''The Birth of Nation'' cost "just a little more than $100,000" to produce...}}</ref> (the equivalent of ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1915|r=-4}}}} in constant dollars).{{Inflation-fn|US}}

The [[film premiere]]d on February 8, 1915, at [[Clune's Auditorium]] in downtown Los Angeles. At its premiere the film was entitled ''The Clansman,'' but the title was later changed to ''The Birth of a Nation'' to reflect Griffith's belief that the United States emerged from the [[American Civil War]] and Reconstruction as a unified nation.<ref>[http://www.filmsite.org/birt.html  Dirks, Tim, ''The Birth of a Nation'', filmsite.org] Retrieved May 27, 2010.</ref>

===Score===
[[File:Sheet music for "The Perfect Song" from The Birth of a Nation.jpg|thumb|right|Sheet music for "The Perfect Song", one of the themes Breil composed for the film.]]

Although ''The Birth of a Nation'' is commonly regarded as a landmark for its dramatic and visual innovations, its use of music was arguably no less revolutionary.<ref name="hickman77">Hickman 2006, p. 77.</ref> Though film was still silent at the time, it was common practice to distribute musical cue sheets, or less commonly, full scores (usually for [[Theatre organ|organ]] or [[piano]] accompaniment) along with each print of a film.<ref>Hickman 2006, pp. 68–69.</ref>

For ''The Birth of a Nation'', composer [[Joseph Carl Breil]] created a three-hour-long musical score that combined all three types of music in use at the time: adaptations of existing works by classical composers, new arrangements of well-known melodies, and original composed music.<ref name="hickman77"/> Though it had been specifically composed for the film, Breil's score was not used for the Los Angeles première of the film at [[Clune's Auditorium]]; rather, a score compiled by Carli Elinor was performed in its stead, and this score was used exclusively in West Coast showings. Breil's score was not used until the film debuted in New York at the [[Liberty Theatre]], and was the score utilized in all showings save those on the West Coast.<ref name="hickman78"/><ref name="marks-1997"/>

Outside of original compositions, Breil adapted classical music for use in the film, including passages from ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' by [[Carl Maria von Weber]], ''[[Leichte Kavallerie]]'' by [[Franz von Suppé]], [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 6]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], and ''[[Ride of the Valkyries]]'' by [[Richard Wagner]], the latter used as a [[leitmotif]] during the ride of the KKK.<ref name="hickman77"/> Breil also arranged several traditional and popular tunes that would have been recognizable to audiences at the time, including many Southern melodies; among these songs were "[[Maryland, My Maryland]]", "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]", "[[Old Folks at Home]]", "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", "[[America the Beautiful]]", "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]", "[[Auld Lang Syne]]", and "[[Where Did You Get That Hat?]]".<ref name="hickman77"/><ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic |pure_url=yes |class=album |id=mw0000649893 }} |title=Birth of a Nation [Original Soundtrack] |first=Bruce |last=Eder |accessdate=February 6, 2014 |website=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=All Media Network, LLC }}</ref>

In his original compositions for the film, Breil wrote numerous leitmotifs to accompany the appearance of specific characters. The principal love theme that was created for the romance between Elsie Stoneman and Ben Cameron was published as "The Perfect Song" and is regarded as the first marketed "theme song" from a film; it was later even used as the theme song for the popular radio and television sitcom ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]''.<ref name="hickman78">Hickman 2006, p. 78.</ref><ref name="marks-1997">{{cite book |last=Marks |first=Martin Miller |title= Music and the Silent Film : Contexts and Case Studies, 1895-1924 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1997 |isbn=9780195361636 |pages=127–135 }}</ref>

The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), founded in 1909, protested premieres of the film in numerous cities. According to the historian David Copeland, "by the time of the movie's March 3 [1915] premiere in New York City, its subject matter had embroiled the film in charges of racism, protests, and calls for censorship, which began after the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP requested the city's film board ban the movie. Since film boards were composed almost entirely of whites, few review boards initially banned Griffith's picture".<ref>Copeland, David (2010). ''The Media's Role in Defining the Nation: The Active Voice''. Peter Lang Publisher. p. 168.</ref> The NAACP also conducted a public education campaign, publishing articles protesting the film's fabrications and inaccuracies, organizing petitions against it, and conducting education on the facts of the war and Reconstruction.<ref>[http://www.naacp.org/about/history/timeline/ NAACP – Timeline]  {{webarchive |url=http://www.webcitation.org/5mYNygoDO?url=http://www.naacp.org/about/history/timeline/ |date=January 5, 2010 }}</ref>

Because of the lack of success in NAACP's actions to ban the film, on April 17, 1915, NAACP secretary [[Mary Childs Nerney]] wrote to NAACP Executive Committee member George Packard: "I am utterly disgusted with the situation in regard to ''The Birth of a Nation'' ... kindly remember that we have put six weeks of constant effort of this thing and have gotten nowhere."<ref name="historymatters">{{cite web|last1=Nerney|first1=Mary Childs|title=An NAACP Official Calls for Censorship of The Birth of a Nation|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/4966/|website=History Matters|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref>

[[Jane Addams]], an American social worker and social reformer, and the founder of [[Hull House]], voiced her reaction to the film in an interview published by the ''[[New York Post]]'' on March 13, 1915, just ten days after the film was released.<ref name="Stokes_432">{{harvnb|Stokes|2007|p=432}}.</ref> She stated that "One of the most unfortunate things about this film is that it appeals to race prejudice upon the basis of conditions of half a century ago, which have nothing to do with the facts we have to consider to-day. Even then it does not tell the whole truth. It is claimed that the play is historical: but history is easy to misuse."<ref name="Stokes_432"/>

When the film was released, riots broke out in Boston, Philadelphia and other major cities in the United States. The film's inflammatory nature was a catalyst for gangs of whites to attack blacks. On 24 April 1916, the ''[[Chicago American]]'' reported that a white man murdered a black teenager in [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]], Indiana after seeing the film, although there has been some controversy as to whether the murderer had actually seen ''The Birth of a Nation''.<ref>Gallen, Ira H. & Stern Seymour. ''D.W. Griffith's 100th Anniversary The Birth of a Nation'' (2014) p.47f.</ref> The mayor of [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]] was the first of twelve mayors to ban the film in 1915 out of concern that it would promote race prejudice, after meeting with a delegation of black citizens.<ref>Gaines, Jane M. (2001). ''Fire and Desire: Mixed-Race Movies in the Silent Era''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 334.</ref> The NAACP set up a precedent-setting national boycott of the film, likely seen as the most successful effort. Additionally, they organized a mass demonstration when the film was screened in Boston, and it was banned in three states and several cities.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Reel Politics, American Political Movies from Birth of a Nation to Platoon|last = Christensen|first = Terry|publisher = Basil Blackwell Inc.|year = 1987|isbn = 0-631-15844-8|location = New York|pages = 19}}</ref>

[[Thomas Dixon, Jr.]], author of ''The Birth of a Nation''{{'}}s source play and novel ''[[The Clansman]]'', was a former classmate of then-president [[Woodrow Wilson]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Dixon managed to arrange a screening of ''The Birth of a Nation'' at the [[White House]] for Wilson, members of his cabinet, and their families, in what was at the time one of the first ever screenings at the White House. Wilson was falsely reported to have said about the film, "It is like writing history with lightning. And my only regret is that it is all so terribly true".<ref>{{cite book|last1=McEwan|first1=Paul|title=The Birth of a Nation|date=2015|publisher=Palgrave|location=London|isbn=978-1-84457-657-9|pages=80–81}}</ref> Wilson's aide, [[Joseph Tumulty]], denied the claims and said that "the President was entirely unaware of the nature of the play before it was presented and at no time has expressed his approbation of it."<ref>Letter from J.

Tumulty, secretary to President Wilson, to the Boston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, quoted in Link, ''Wilson''.</ref> Historians believe the quote attributed to Wilson originated with Dixon, who was relentless in publicizing the film.

Griffith, indignant at the film's negative critical reception, wrote letters to newspapers, and published a pamphlet in which he accused his critics of censoring unpopular opinions.<ref name="Mayer_166">Mayer, David (2009).

He also added that the man who wrote the editorial was "damaging my reputation as a producer" and "a liar and a coward".<ref>{{Cite journal |url=web.uvic.ca/~ayh/Lenning.doc |title=Myth and Fact: The Reception of The Birth of a Nation |last=Lennig |first=Arthur |date = April 2004 |journal=Film History |doi = |pmid = |access-date = 16 February 2016}}</ref> He conceived his next film, ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), as a response to those who had censored his film.<ref name="Mayer_166"/>

Despite the film's controversy, ''The Birth of a Nation'' was very popular. At over three hours in length (including intermissions), the film was ground-breaking in its production value, budget and ambition. At the time, the film was unlike anything the American audiences had ever seen before.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McEwan|first1=Paul|title=The Birth of a Nation |date=2015 |publisher=Palgrave |location=London |isbn=978-1-84457-657-9 |page=12}}</ref>

==Sequel, appropriations, and spin-offs==
D. W. Griffith made a film in 1916, called ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'', partly in response to the criticism that ''Birth of a Nation'' received. Griffith has made clear within numerous interviews that the film's title and main themes were chosen in response to those who Griffith felt had been intolerant to his ''Birth of a Nation''.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Birth of a Nation (BFI Film Classics)|last = McEwan|first = Paul|publisher = BFI/Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-84457-657-9|location = London|pages = 14}}</ref>

A sequel called ''[[The Fall of a Nation]]'' was released in 1916. It was the first sequel in film history.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Story of Hollywood: An Illustrated History|first=Gregory Paul |last=Williams |year= |publisher= |page=87 |isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9W4R_CZtFe8C&pg=PA87&dq=the+fall+of+a+nation+first+sequel&lr=#v=onepage&q=the%20fall%20of%20a%20nation%20first%20sequel&f=false}}</ref> The film was directed by [[Thomas Dixon, Jr.]], who adapted it from [[The Fall of a Nation (novel)|his own novel of the same name]].

In 1918, an American silent drama film directed by John W. Noble called ''[[The Birth of a Race]]'' was released as a direct response to ''The Birth of a Nation''.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/pfop-notorious-silent-movie-drew-local-protests/article_c281212a-a5b7-532e-9745-03ee6b70e623.html |title=Notorious silent movie drew local protests |newspaper= [[The Pantagraph]] |date= 2016-02-07 |accessdate= 2016-04-11 |last= Kemp |first= Bill}}</ref> The film was an ambitious project by producer [[Emmett Jay Scott]] to challenge Griffith's film and tell another side of the story, but was ultimately unsuccessful.<ref>{{harvnb|Stokes|2007|p=166}}</ref>

In 1919, the director/producer/writer [[Oscar Micheaux]] released ''[[Within Our Gates]]'', a response from the African-American community. Notably, he reversed a key scene of Griffith's film by depicting a white man assaulting a black woman.

The film was remixed in 2004 as ''Rebirth of a Nation'', a live cinema experience by [[DJ Spooky]] at Lincoln Center, and has toured at many venues around the world including [[The Acropolis]] as a live cinema "remix". The remix version was also presented at Paula Cooper Gallery in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulacoopergallery.com/exhibitions/395 |title=Rebirth of a Nation at Paula Cooper Gallery |publisher=Paulacoopergallery.com |date=2004-06-18 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref>

In 2016, [[Nate Parker]] produced and directed the film ''[[The Birth of a Nation (2016 film)|The Birth of a Nation]]'', based on the 1831 slave rebellion led by [[Nat Turner]]. Parker states: "I've reclaimed this title and re-purposed it as a tool to challenge racism and white supremacy in America, to inspire a riotous disposition toward any and all injustice in this country (and abroad) and to promote the kind of honest confrontation that will galvanize our society toward healing and sustained systemic change."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://filmmakermagazine.com/97103-five-questions-with-the-birth-of-a-nation-director-nate-parker/#.VsC1bvmLTIU|title = Five Questions with the Birth of a Nation director Nate Parkr|date = 25 January 2016|access-date = |website = Filmmaker magazine|publisher = |last = Rezayazdi|first = Soheil}}</ref>

==Ideology and accuracy==
[[File:Wilson-quote-in-birth-of-a-nation.jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson]]'s ''History of the American People'' is quoted in ''The Birth of a Nation''.]]
The film remains controversial due to its interpretation of American history. [[University of Houston]] historian Steven Mintz summarizes its message as follows: [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was a disaster, blacks could never be [[racial integration|integrated]] into white society as equals, and the violent actions of the Ku Klux Klan were justified to reestablish honest government.<ref>[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/slaveryfilm.cfm UG.edu], Digital History.</ref> The South is portrayed as a victim. The first overt mentioning of the war is the scene in which Abraham Lincoln signs the call for the first 75,000 volunteers. However, the first aggression in the Civil War, made when the Confederate troops fired on [[Fort Sumter]] in 1861, is not mentioned in the film.<ref>{{harvnb|Stokes|2007|p=184}}.</ref>  The film suggested that the Ku Klux Klan restored order to the postwar South, which was depicted as endangered by abolitionists, freedmen, and [[carpetbagger|carpetbagging]] [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] politicians from the North. This reflects the so-called [[Dunning School]] of historiography.<ref>{{harvnb|Stokes|2007|pp=190–91}}.</ref> The film portrays President [[Abraham Lincoln]] as a friend of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], and refers to him as "the Great Heart".<ref>{{harvnb|Stokes|2007|p=188}}.</ref>  The two romances depicted in the film,  Phil Stoneman with Margaret Cameron and Ben Cameron with Elsie Stoneman, reflect Griffith's retelling of history.  The couples are used as a metaphor, representing the film's broader message of the need for the reconciliation of the North and South to defend white supremacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmracepolitics.weebly.com/blog|title=The Birth of a Nation: The Significance of Love, Romance, and Sexuality|date=March 6, 2015|publisher=Weebly|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref> Among both couples, there is an attraction that forms before the war, stemming from the friendship between their families.  With the war, though, both families are split apart, and their losses culminate in the end of the war with the defense of white supremacy.  One of the intertitles clearly sums up the message of unity, stating, "The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their Aryan birthright." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Vol8No2/SalterBirth.htm|title=The Birth of a Nation as American Myth|first= Richard C.|last=Salter|website=The Journal of Religion and Film|series=Vol. 8, No. 2|date=October 2004|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}</ref>

Some historians, such as [[E. Merton Coulter]] in his ''The South Under Reconstruction'' (1947), maintained the Dunning School view after World War II. Today, the Dunning School position is largely seen as a product of anti-black racism of the early 20th century, by which many Americans held that black Americans were unequal as citizens.

Veteran film reviewer [[Roger Ebert]] wrote,
{{quote|... stung by criticisms that the second half of his masterpiece was racist in its glorification of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and its brutal images of blacks, Griffith tried to make amends in ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), which criticized prejudice. And in ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' he told perhaps the first [[miscegenation|interracial love]] story in the movies—even though, to be sure, it's an idealized love with no touching.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000123/REVIEWS08/1230301/1023 |title=Great Movies: 'Broken Blossoms' |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= January 23, 2000 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}</ref>}}

Despite some similarities between the Congressman Stoneman character and  Rep. [[Thaddeus Stevens]] of [[Pennsylvania]], Rep. Stevens did not have the family members described and did not move to South Carolina during Reconstruction. He died in Washington, D.C. in 1868. However, Stevens' biracial housekeeper, [[Lydia Hamilton Smith]], was considered his common-law wife, and generously provided for in his will.<ref>[[Marc Egnal]], ''Clash of Extremes'', 2009.</ref>

The depictions of mass Klan paramilitary actions do not seem to have historical equivalents, although there were incidents in 1871 where Klan groups traveled from other areas in fairly large numbers to aid localities in disarming local companies of the all-black portion of the state militia under various justifications, prior to the eventual Federal troop intervention, and the organized Klan's continued activities as small groups of "night riders."<ref>West, Jerry Lee. ''The Reconstruction Ku Klux Klan in York County, South Carolina, 1865–1877'' (2002) p. 67</ref>

The [[Civil Rights Movement]] and other social movements created a new generation of historians, such as scholar [[Eric Foner]], who led a reassessment of Reconstruction. Building on [[Black Reconstruction in America|W.E.B. DuBois' work]] but also adding new sources, they focused on achievements of the African-American and white Republican coalitions, such as establishment of universal public education and charitable institutions in the South and extension of [[suffrage]] to black men. In response, the Southern-dominated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and its affiliated white militias had used extensive terrorism, intimidation and outright assassinations to suppress African-American leaders and voting in the 1870s and to regain power.<ref>[[Nicholas Lemann]], ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War''.

Released in 1915, ''The Birth of a Nation'' has been credited as groundbreaking among its contemporaries for its innovative application of the medium of film. According to the film historian [[Kevin Brownlow]], the film was "astounding in its time" and initiated "so many advances in film-making technique that it was rendered obsolete within a few years".<ref>Brownlow, Kevin (1968). ''The Parade's Gone By...''. University of California Press. p. 78. ISBN 0520030680.</ref> The content of the work, however, has received widespread criticism for its blatantly racist and fantastical depictions of scenes that are presented onscreen as if in documentary form. {{Citation needed|Following sources mention no "documentary" form|date=April 2016}} Film critic Roger Ebert writes, "Certainly ''The Birth of a Nation'' (1915) presents a challenge for modern audiences. Unaccustomed to silent films and uninterested in film history, they find it quaint and not to their taste. Those evolved enough to understand what they are looking at find the early and wartime scenes brilliant, but cringe during the postwar and Reconstruction scenes, which are racist in the ham-handed way of an old minstrel show or a vile comic pamphlet".<ref name=Ebert>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=The Birth of a Nation (1915)|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030330/REVIEWS08/303300301/1023|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=February 21, 2011|date=March 30, 2003}}</ref> ''"Birth of a Nation'' was the first picture that really made people take the motion picture industry seriously", said [[Mary Pickford]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Howe |first=Herbert |date=January 1924 |title=Mary Pickford's Favorite Stars and Films |url=https://archive.org/stream/pho26chic#page/n31/mode/2up |journal=[[Photoplay]] |location=New York |publisher=Photoplay Publishing Company |access-date=September 4, 2015 }}</ref>

In 1992, the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. Despite its controversial story, the film has been praised by film critics such as [[Roger Ebert]], who said: "''The Birth of a Nation'' is not a bad film because it argues for evil. Like Riefenstahl's ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'', it is a great film that argues for evil. To understand how it does so is to learn a great deal about film, and even something about evil."<ref name=Ebert/> The website ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', which compiles reviews from various sources, indicates the film has a 100% approval rating.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/birth_of_a_nation/ | title=The Birth of a Nation Movie Reviews | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc | accessdate=July 19, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629011751/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/birth_of_a_nation/ |archivedate = June 29, 2011|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

According to a 2002 article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the film facilitated the refounding of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s.<ref>[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/316.html Hartford-HWP.com], A Painful Present as Historians Confront a Nation's Bloody Past.</ref> As late as the 1970s, the Ku Klux Klan continued to use the film as a recruitment tool.

"The Birth of a Nation" proudly conveyed fallacious ideals that are commonly described as "controversial" and "explicitly racist". In fact, Tim Dirks writes that, "the film is still used today as a recruitment piece for Klan membership". <ref>{{cite web|last1=Dirks|first1=Tim|title=Filmsite Movie Review|url=http://www.filmsite.org/birt.html|website=Filmsiteorg|accessdate=11/28/16}}</ref>  As our first feature length film, historians note "Birth of a Nation" as one of the most influential artifacts in American history.

The perpetuation of these race-driven ideologies have been linked to, "general antagonism towards black males", "lack of identification with or sympathy for black males", "public support for punitive solutions to problems" where black men are involved. 

''The Birth of a Nation'' paints a gross misrepresentation of the African-American as "brutish, lazy, morally degenerate and dangerous".<ref>{{cite web|title=Birth of A Nation Opens|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/birth-of-a-nation-opens|website=history.com|publisher=A+E Networks}}</ref> The perpetuation of these race-driven ideologies have been linked to, "general antagonism towards black males", "lack of identification with or sympathy for black males", "public support for punitive solutions to problems" where black men are involved. <ref>{{cite web|title=Media Representations and Impacts on The Lives of Black Men and Boys|url=https://opportunityagenda.org/files/field_file/2011.11.30%20%7C%20Report%20%7C%20Media%20Representation%20and%20Impact%20on%20the%20Lives%20of%20Black%20Men%20and%20Boys%20%7C%20FINAL.pdf|website=The Opportunity Agenda|publisher=Tides Center}}</ref>

==New opening titles on re-release==
One famous part of the film was added by Griffith only on the second run of the film<ref>Richard Schickel (1984). ''D. W. Griffith: An American Life''. New York: Limelight Editions, p. 282</ref> and is missing from most online versions of the film (presumably taken from first run prints.)<ref>This includes the one at the Internet Movie Archive [https://archive.org/details/dw_griffith_birth_of_a_nation] and the Google video copy [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5639233838609252948#] and Veoh [http://www.veoh.com/browse/videos/category/entertainment/watch/v1640308YD8z9qcp Watch Videos Online | The Birth of a Nation | Veoh.com]. However, of multiple YouTube copies one which has the full opening titles is {{YouTube|vPxRIF1c2fI|DW GRIFFITH THE BIRTH OF A NATION PART 1 1915}}</ref>

These are the second and third of three opening title cards which defend the film. The added titles read:
<blockquote>
A PLEA FOR THE ART OF THE MOTION PICTURE:
We do not fear censorship, for we have no wish to offend with improprieties or obscenities, but we do demand, as a right, the liberty to show the dark side of wrong, that we may illuminate the bright side of virtue – the same liberty that is conceded to the art of the written word – that art to which we owe the Bible and the works of Shakespeare
</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>
If in this work we have conveyed to the mind the ravages of war to the end that war may be held in abhorrence, this effort will not have been in vain.
</blockquote>
Various film historians have expressed a range of views about these titles. To Nicholas Andrew Miller, this shows that "Griffith's greatest achievement in ''The Birth of a Nation'' was that he brought the cinema's capacity for spectacle... under the rein of an outdated, but comfortably literary form of historical narrative. Griffith's models... are not the pioneers of film spectacle... but the giants of literary narrative".<ref>{{cite book |title=Modernism, Ireland and the erotics of memory |last=Miller |first= Nicholas Andrew |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-81583-5|page=226  |url= }}</ref> On the other hand, S.

Kittrell |year=2007 |publisher=Purdue University Press |isbn=1-55753-440-3|page=307 |url= }}</ref> while Stanley Corkin complains that Griffith "masks his idea of fact in the rhetoric of high art and free expression" and creates film which "erodes the very ideal" of "liberty" which he asserts.<ref>{{cite book |title=Realism and the birth of the modern United States:cinema, literature, and culture |last=Corkin |first=Stanley |year=1996  |publisher=University of Georgia Press |isbn=0-8203-1730-6|pages=144–145 }}</ref>

==Home media and restorations==

''Birth of a Nation,'' even more than other films in the public domain, has been poorly represented in later releases. The problem, in part, is that Griffith and others have reworked the film, leaving no definitive version. According to the silent film website ''Brenton Film'', "there are a multitude of poor quality DVDs with different edits, scores, running speeds and usually in ''definitely unoriginal'' black and white".<ref name="Brenton Film">{{cite web|url= http://www.brentonfilm.com/articles/the-birth-of-a-nation-controversial-classic-gets-a-definitive-new-restoration|title=''The Birth of a Nation: Controversial Classic Gets a Definitive New Restoration''|work=Brenton Film|accessdate=23 February 2016}}</ref>

There are exceptions. Among them is film preservationist [[David Shepard (film preservationist)|David Shepard]]'s 1992 transfer of a 16mm print for VHS and laserdisc release via [[Image Entertainment]]. A short documentary, ''The Making of The Birth of a Nation'', newly produced and narrated by Shepard, was also included. Both were released on DVD by Image in 1998 and the UK's Eureka Entertainment in 2000.<ref name="Brenton Film"/>

In the UK, [[Photoplay Productions]] restored the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s 35mm print that was the source of Shepard's 16mm print, though they also augmented it with extra material from the [[British Film Institute]]. It was also given a full orchestral recording of the original Breil score. Though broadcast on [[Channel 4]] television and theatrically screened many times, Photoplay's 1993 version was never released on home video.<ref name="Brenton Film"/>

Shepard's transfer and documentary were reissued in the US by [[Kino International (company)|Kino Video]] in 2002, this time in a 2-DVD set with added extras on the second disc. These included several Civil War shorts also directed by D.W. Griffith.<ref name="Brenton Film"/>

In 2011 Kino prepared a HD transfer of a 35mm negative from the Paul Killiam Collection. They added some material from the [[Library of Congress]] and gave it a new compilation score. This version was released on Blu-ray by Kino in the US, Eureka in the UK (as part of their "[[Masters of Cinema]]" collection) and Divisa Home Video in Spain.<ref name="Brenton Film"/>

In 2015, the year of the film's centenary, [[Photoplay Productions]]' [[Patrick Stanbury]], in conjunction with the British Film Institute, carried out the first full restoration. It mostly used new 4K scans of the LoC's original camera negative, along with other early generation material. It too was given the original Breil score and featured the film's original  tinting for the first time since its 1915 release. The restoration was released on a 2-Blu-ray set by the BFI, alongside a host of extras, including many other newly restored Civil War related films from the period.<ref name="Brenton Film"/>
