The '''anthophytes''' were thought{{when|date=April 2015}} {{by whom|date=December 2015}} to be a [[clade]] comprising plants bearing flower-like structures.  The group contained the [[angiosperms]] - the extant flowering plants, such as [[Rosaceae|roses]] and [[Poaceae|grasses]] - as well as the [[Gnetales]] and the extinct [[Bennettitales]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Doyle |first1=J.

Detailed morphological and molecular studies have shown that the group is not actually monophyletic, with proposed floral homologies of the gnetophytes and the angiosperms having evolved in parallel.<ref name=Crepet2000/>  This makes it easier to reconcile molecular clock data that suggests that the angiosperms diverged from the gymnosperms around {{Ma|300}}.<ref name=Nam2003>{{cite journal | author=Nam J.  | url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/20/9/1435 |title=Antiquity and Evolution of the MADS-Box Gene Family Controlling Flower Development in Plants | journal=Mol.

Some more recent studies have used the word anthophyte to describe a group which includes the angiosperms and a variety of fossils ([[Glossopteris|glossopterids]], ''[[Pentoxylon]]'', [[Bennettitales]], and ''[[Caytonia]]''), but not the Gnetales.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.annalsnyas.org/cgi/content/abstract/1133/1/3 | title = The Year in Evolutionary Biology 2008 | date = June 2008 | journal = Ann.
